## Financial Statements

- Companies Act 2006 := primary source of UK company law
- Insurance Accounts Directive regulations := insurance companies must follow
- Accounts follow five concepts:
  - Going concern
  - Accruals basis
  - Consistency
  - Prudence and realisation
  - Separate valuation of assets and liabilites
- Based on local generally accepted accounting principles (`GAAP`)
- For EEA states, local GAAP based on how member state adopted Insurance Accounts Directive
- Comprises balance sheet, profit and loss account, notes to the accounts
- Companies Act accounts in UK also include:
  - Cashflow statement
  - Directors' report
  - Auditors' report
- Balance sheet assets:
  - Investments
  - Reinsurers' share of technical provisions
  - Debtor items
  - Other assets
  - Prepayments and accrued income (includes deferred acquisition costs)
- Balance sheet liabilities:
  - Capital
  - Reserves (gross technical provisions)
  - Provision for other risks
  - Creditor items
- P&L split:
  - Technical account for general business
    - Earned premiums and other income (gross and reinsurance)
    - net claims incurred
    - net operating expenses and other technical charges
    - investment income (normally first recognised in non-technical account)
  - Technical account for long-term business (if composite insurer)
  - Non-technical account
- Gives true and fair view of company's finances at the end of a financial year and the profit/loss for the financial year
  - For benefit of shareholders, policyholders and anyone who has business dealings with company

Technical account for general business:

> part of the Profit and Loss Account for insurance companies within the EU. It is made up of earned premiums less incurred claims (both adjusted for reinsurance as appropriate), less expenses (with an allowance for deferred acquisition costs as appropriate), plus any part of the investment income that may be allocated to the technical account.

## Statutory Returns

- Differ from annual accounting as liabilities calculated on different basis
  - Solvency II: no UPR or DAC
- Solvency II statutory returns comprise:
  - Public exposure element - Solvency and Financial Condition Report (`SFCR`)
  - Private reporting element to supervisory authority - Regular Supervisory Report (`RSR`)
- SFCR comprises templates and narrative info on areas set out in regulations
  - Produced annually
- Templates called Quantitative Report Templates (`QRTs`)
  - Analyses of assets, TPs, other liabilites, premiums and expenses
  - At company level
  - At class of business level
- Narrative info on business & performance, system of governance and risk profile
- RSR is private
  - Submit report in full at least every 3 years
  - Summary annually
  - Includes both qualitative and quantitative info
  - Comprises SFCR with addtional detail

## Management Accounts

- Purpose of internal management accounts:
  - Determine profitability for each class
  - Determine need for rating revisions and assist in carrying them out
  - Project company's financial position
    - Including profit testing
  - Analyse / project:
    - claims and exposure
    - expenses
    - reserves
    - RI performance
    - movement rates
    - business mix, volumes, results by source of business
- Normally value best estimate assets and liabilities
  - Remove margins on outstanding claims
  - Liabilities maybe discounted at appropriate rate of interest
  - May set explicit contingency reserves not appropriate in statutory accounts, useful for internal reporting purposes
- May look at future cashflows
  - Concerned with major fluctuation in immediate market values
  - Impact such movements have on solvency calculations
  - Impact on perceptions of regulators and rating agencies
- Vary bases for:
  - sensitivity of results to changes in assumptions
  - investigate worst-case scenarios
  - consider prospective results on Companies Act and statutory returns bases
- Required each month / quarter
- Special investigations
- Variations between companies

## Discounting

**Solvency II**

- TPs comprise best estimate plus risk margin
- Best estimate cashflows discounted to allow time value of money
  - In accordance with Solvency II rules

**Financial Statements**

- Varies by country to country
- UK GAAP := explicit discounting permitted if expected average term from accounting date to final settlement of claims is at least 4 years
  - Relevant for annuities for non-life business (PPOs)
  - Uncommon for other liabilities
- If insurer discounts liabilities needs adequate data at its disposal to construct relaible model of rate of claims settlements

**Discounting basis**

- Discount rate should not normally exceed return expected to achieve on investments
- Degree of caution depends on purpose of accounts
- Usually insurer does not deduct tax from discount rate => claims are tax deductible
- Fixed rate from year to year makes comparisons simpler (favoured by accountants)
- Consider discount rate vary by class / currency of business
- Discounting reserves := reserving on a weaker basis
  - TPs smaller
  - Profits brought forward
  - Apparent solvency larger

**P&L statement impact**

- Generic P&L statement:
- `Net earned premium` = net premiums written + net UPR b/f - net UPR c/f
- `Net incurred claims` = net claims paid - net OS claims b/f + net OS claims c/f
- `Expenses`
- `Change in DAC`
- `Undewriting profit` := `Net earned premium` - `Net incurred claims` - `Expenses` + `Change in DAC`
- `Insurance profit` := `Underwriting profit` + Investment return (_on insurance funds_)
- `Operating profit` := `Insurance profit` + Investment return (_on free reserves_)
- `Post-tax profit` := `Operating profit` - Tax
- `Retained profit` := `Post-tax profit` - Dividends

- Impact of discounting on P&L statement:
- `Net earned premium` - only changed if UPR discounted (e.g. extended warranty)
- `Net claims incurred` - reduced by net OS claims c/f discount
- `Underwriting profit` - larger
- `Investment return` - no change overall (total assets available unchanged)
  - Split between technical reserves and free reserve different
  - Change in allocation of investment returns between insurance funds and free reserves
- `Operating profit` - larger
- `Tax` - no change unless HMRC tax basis changes
- `Dividends` - no change unless higher disclosed profit implies higher payout

Overall impact of discounting:

- balance sheet transfer (from technical reserves to free reserves)
- higher disclosed profit
- no change to cashflows
- does not affect actual performance of insurer
- impacts reporting of results
- management may take different actions based on reported results
  - can materially impact results in later years

**Calculating discounted reserves**

- Apply rate of discount to emerging flow of claim payments (given / projected) to calculate discount reserve
- Calculate accounts to demonstrate effect of rate of emergence and eventual extent of profit
