## Why exit

- No longer part of (re)insurer's core strategy
- Business represents small proportion of total business but requires disproportionate amount of senior management time
- Business represents small proportion of total business but requires disproportionate amount of capital
- Business was purchased as part of larger acquisition but was not reason for undertaking the transaction
- Business has been/expected to be loss making / insufficiently profitable
  - Result of poor historical experience
  - Anticipated changes in market (regulatory / legal changes)
- (Re)insurer is insolvent => forced by regulator to cease writing new business
- Exit strategies transfer risk and achieve certainty/finality
- Exit stratgies include:
  - run-off to exhaustion
  - reinsurance
  - commutations
  - novation
  - insurance business transfers (`IBT`)
  - sale of business
- Strategies are not mutually exclusive
  - Common to use combination, same time / different times
  - Example: run business off to exhaustion, employ active commutation programme to run off business quicker
  - Example: buy reinsurance immediately after deciding to exit, then arrange IBT (possibly to the reinsurer) after period of time
- Considerations for exit strategy:
  - Negotiating strength
  - Initiator of deal
  - Risk appetite, desired level of risk transfer
  - Costs involved
  - Availability of alternatives
  - Reasons for exiting
  - Industry practice
  - Uncertainty, length of tail
  - Time taken to implement solution vs. time available
  - Views of regulators and other external parties involved
  - Perception of deal from other stakeholders (policyholders, shareholders, rating agencies, reinsurers, regulators)
  - Financial strength of insurer
  - Extent and quality of remaining reinsurance protection
  - Cashflow and capital impact
  - Tax implications

## Run-off

- Company ceases to write any new business or renewals in line(s) exited
- Continues to retain responsibility for administering and paying claims for historical business previously underwritten
- Effectively _close the book_ - continue to manage existing business as it runs off
- Company typically maintains required business functions (claims handlers) for many years to come (especially long-tailed lines) where claims take significant number of years to emerge, be reported and settle
- As level of claims activity decreases over time => difficult to manage portfolio successfully
  - Management time and capital required disproportionately high
  - Maintaining appropriate staffing levels expensive
  - Solution: run off to exhaustion but outsource daily admin functions to specialist run-off provider
- Outsourcing does not remove insurer from its original responsibilities
  - Company still liable for cost of claims that arise
  - Company still required to fulfil regulatory reporting and capital requirements
- Usually employ this strategy for limited time before considering alternative, faster exit strategy
- Major advantage: re-entry is easy
- Advantage: direct costs associated with other methods not incurred
- Long term use of this strategy reserved for small lines within larger portfolio where insurer can utilise wider claims team to support run-off
- Disadvantage: additional reinsurance may be needed to be purchased during run-off period, e.g. to cope with reducing capital available to support the business
- Disadvantage: problems retaining staff due to low morale given longer-term outlook

## Reinsurance

- Fully reinsuring all future claims that may arise from historical business written
- Reinsurer may administer and settle all future claims itself => insurer has minimal future involvement in business
- Adverse development cover - typical arrangement to transfer some/all future claims liabilities from historical business to reinsurer (subject to reinsurer default risk)

### Level of risk transfer

- Not always possible to fully reinsure portfolio
- Example: reinsurer only willing to cover future claim payments when in aggregate they are in excess of lower limit
- May be an upper limit cap => limits amount reinsurer will pay (e.g. stop loss arrangement)
- Once reinsurer paid out claims up to cap, futhre claim payments revert back to insurer
- Reinsurer may only cover certain proportion of claim payments between lower limit and cap (deductible, participation clause, coinsurance)
  - Often used to maintain insurer's interest in controlling claims experience once lower limit of reinsurance layer breached
- Insurer continues to remain ultimately liable for underlying claim payments
- Reinsurer may agree to pay 100% of all future claim payments but becomes insolvent and unable to make further payments
  - Insurer remains liable to policyholders for valid claims and would have to pay all future claim payments directly irrespective of whether insurer able to make reinsurance recoveries
- Reinsurance as exit strategy => insurer never totally tansfers risk due to reinsurer default risk

### Cost and availability

- Insurer will need to pay reinsurance premium
- Premium dependant on:
  - estimated cost of liabilites given precise structure of reinsurance
  - uncertainty around estimated cost
  - anticipated future investment return
  - costs of ongoing adminstration
  - capital required to support liabilities
  - financial strength of reinsurer
  - required return on capital (profit loading)
- Technical cost determined by actuaries
- Market forces (availablity of reinsurance) influences actual reinsurance premium
- Insurer can compare premium with current level of reserves held
  - Reinsurance premium paid out of current free reserves, if sizeable could jeopardise solvency

### Ongoing requirements

- Once reinsurance placed, insurer may have little future involvement in business
- Some involvement remains:
  - include business in regulatory reporting
  - regulatory capital assessment
- Some cases insurer required to continue to administer and settle all future claims itself, making reinsurance recoveries
  - Successful administration management difficult as level of claims activity decreases over time

## Commutation

- Commutation := insurance policy is cancelled, with agreement of both parties, such that no further claims can be made under the policy
  - Policyholder loses right to make any more claims in respect of either future or past periods of cover
- Commutations usually insurer-initiated approach to ending exposure
- Often employ active commutation programme in order to accelerate run-off business beyond what naturally occurs
  - Includes inwards and outwards business
  - Insurer pay policyholders to commute primary policies
  - Reinsurer pay insurer to commute its reinsurance policies
- Extreme scenario: company commutes all insurance policies such tath no claims remain outstanding and no further claims could be received
- In practice: only certain policies within portfolio commuted => limiting factor in exit strategy
- Insurer effects commutation, pays amount of money to policyholder in compensation for any future claims no longer payable under the insurance policy
- Policy buy-backs := insurer pays policyholder to lapse the policy
  - Commutation involving direct policy between insurer and policyholder
  - Commutation normally refers to termination of reinsurance contract
  - Terms are used interchangeably
- Effecting commutation, insurer releases itself from paying all future claims under the policy usually including those claims already notified but not yet paid
  - Reduces capital requirements and administration costs
- Policyholer's viewpoint:
  - commutation improves their current cashflow
  - commutation amount received > present value of future claims
- Likelihood of succesful commutation depends on ability of policyholder and insurer to reach agreement
  - Other exit strategies: either insurer does not need to reach agreement (e.g. `IBT`) or through alternative parties (e.g. reinsurance)
- Regulatory requirements: some insurance types cannot be commuted
  - Example: compulsory for policyholder to hold specific insurance

### Process

- Stages between policyholder and insurer to effect commutation
- Stage 1: Agree policy/policies to be commuted and current outstanding balances
  - Amounts due to be paid shortly
  - Any case reserves held
  - One insured may have several different policies if commercial arrangement
- Stage 2: Value ultimate liabilities under policies to be commuted
  - Including allowance for IBNeR and pure IBNR
  - Typically policyholder and insurer each perform own valuation
    - As commutation amount negotiated
    - Both parties determine own best estimate value of policies
- Stage 3: Parties negotiate consideration to be paid from insurer to policyholder to effect commutation
- Stage 4: Legal wording to effect commutation drafted and agreed

### Negotiation

- Level of uncertainty surrounding ultimate liabilities
  - High uncertainty => more likely future claims experience significantly deviate from valuation
  - Potential for adverse movements exceeds potential for favourable movement
  - Commutation consideration paid likely to exceed valuation of ultimate liabilitiesm especially where gerater uncertainty of ultime claims levels
  - Uncertainty typically greater for long-tailed classes
  - Long-tailed classes length of time before claims reported typically longer => estimate of IBNR greater and more difficult to predict
  - Long-tailed claims typically longer to settle => final settlement figure more uncertain
- Administration cost savings
  - Once commutation effected, insurer no longer has to carry out administration task in respect of origin policies => substantial cost savings
  - Savings significant when commutation programme results in no further policies remaining for particular LOB/portfolio/branch, e.g. fixed expenses can be removed more completely (e.g. claims handling department salaries)
  - Commutation consideration paid allows for such cost savings => higher commutation payment to insured
- Impact of future investment return
  - Commuting results in policyholder receiving sum of money now rather than possibility of claim payments in future
  - Depending on class, policyholder receives money many years earlier
  - Parties should consider future investment return on this sum of money
  - Positive impact on insured, negative impact on insurer => reduces commutation consideration
- Financial strength of insurer
  - Policyholder removes credit risk associated with holding insurance policy
  - Credit risk := risk future claim payments not (fully) paid by insurer or not paid in timely manner
    - Credit risk attached to insurance policy closely related to predicted future financial strength of insurer
  - Risk could be substantial as commutation may be motivated by solvency
  - Commutation consideration should allow for removal of credit risk
    - Amount depends on future predicted financial strength of insurer and time period claim payments expected
    - Where policyholder expects to receive claim payments over longer period of time => greater uncertainty over ability of insurer to meet such payments => more beneficial to receive certain amount money now
  - If insurer entered run-off typically it is at greater risk of insolvency => beneficial to policyholders to commute early to ensure pay-oput
    - However if risk of insolvency, regulators may restrict ability of insurers to carry out large-scale commutation if it risks causing insolvency
- Impact of outwards reinsurance where inwards contracts commuted
  - Insurer may commute insurance contracts which normally would make reinsurance recoveries as business is reinsured
  - When commuting policies reinsurer not necessarily required to pay its share of consideration paid to policyholder in resepect of commutation
    - Basic contract between insurer and policyholder, reinsurer is not a party of
  - Insurer will have separate negotiations with any reinsurers involved in policies being commuted
  - Alternatively insurer can commute outwards reinsurance prior to commuting inwards contracts
  - Some circumstances (reinsurance business), reinsurer looking to effect commutation may have insured same compay that it also purchased outwards reinsurance from => reinsurer look to effect an inwards and outwards commutation with relevant party

## Novation

- Novation := complete transfer of business from one insurer to another, with the agreement of all three parties (the policyholder, the old insurer and the new insurer)
- Novation replaces old insurer with new insurer, no contractual liability remains with old insurer
  - Old insurer makes an accompanying payment to new insurer
