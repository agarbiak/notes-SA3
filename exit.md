## Why exit

- No longer part of (re)insurer's core strategy
- Business represents small proportion of total business but requires disproportionate amount of senior management time
- Business represents small proportion of total business but requires disproportionate amount of capital
- Business was purchased as part of larger acquisition but was not reason for undertaking the transaction
- Business has been/expected to be loss making / insufficiently profitable
  - Result of poor historical experience
  - Anticipated changes in market (regulatory / legal changes)
- (Re)insurer is insolvent => forced by regulator to cease writing new business
- Exit strategies transfer risk and achieve certainty/finality
- Exit stratgies include:
  - run-off to exhaustion
  - reinsurance
  - commutations
  - novation
  - insurance business transfers (`IBT`)
  - sale of business
- Strategies are not mutually exclusive
  - Common to use combination, same time / different times
  - Example: run business off to exhaustion, employ active commutation programme to run off business quicker
  - Example: buy reinsurance immediately after deciding to exit, then arrange IBT (possibly to the reinsurer) after period of time
- Considerations for exit strategy:
  - Negotiating strength
  - Initiator of deal
  - Risk appetite, desired level of risk transfer
  - Costs involved
  - Availability of alternatives
  - Reasons for exiting
  - Industry practice
  - Uncertainty, length of tail
  - Time taken to implement solution vs. time available
  - Views of regulators and other external parties involved
  - Perception of deal from other stakeholders (policyholders, shareholders, rating agencies, reinsurers, regulators)
  - Financial strength of insurer
  - Extent and quality of remaining reinsurance protection
  - Cashflow and capital impact
  - Tax implications

## Run-off

- Company ceases to write any new business or renewals in line(s) exited
- Continues to retain responsibility for administering and paying claims for historical business previously underwritten
- Effectively _close the book_ - continue to manage existing business as it runs off
- Company typically maintains required business functions (claims handlers) for many years to come (especially long-tailed lines) where claims take significant number of years to emerge, be reported and settle
- As level of claims activity decreases over time => difficult to manage portfolio successfully
  - Management time and capital required disproportionately high
  - Maintaining appropriate staffing levels expensive
  - Solution: run off to exhaustion but outsource daily admin functions to specialist run-off provider
- Outsourcing does not remove insurer from its original responsibilities
  - Company still liable for cost of claims that arise
  - Company still required to fulfil regulatory reporting and capital requirements
- Usually employ this strategy for limited time before considering alternative, faster exit strategy
- Major advantage: re-entry is easy
- Advantage: direct costs associated with other methods not incurred
- Long term use of this strategy reserved for small lines within larger portfolio where insurer can utilise wider claims team to support run-off
- Disadvantage: additional reinsurance may be needed to be purchased during run-off period, e.g. to cope with reducing capital available to support the business
- Disadvantage: problems retaining staff due to low morale given longer-term outlook

## Reinsurance

- Fully reinsuring all future claims that may arise from historical business written
- Reinsurer may administer and settle all future claims itself => insurer has minimal future involvement in business
- Adverse development cover - typical arrangement to transfer some/all future claims liabilities from historical business to reinsurer (subject to reinsurer default risk)

### Level of risk transfer

- Not always possible to fully reinsure portfolio
- Example: reinsurer only willing to cover future claim payments when in aggregate they are in excess of lower limit
- May be an upper limit cap => limits amount reinsurer will pay (e.g. stop loss arrangement)
- Once reinsurer paid out claims up to cap, futhre claim payments revert back to insurer
- Reinsurer may only cover certain proportion of claim payments between lower limit and cap (deductible, participation clause, coinsurance)
  - Often used to maintain insurer's interest in controlling claims experience once lower limit of reinsurance layer breached
- Insurer continues to remain ultimately liable for underlying claim payments
- Reinsurer may agree to pay 100% of all future claim payments but becomes insolvent and unable to make further payments
  - Insurer remains liable to policyholders for valid claims and would have to pay all future claim payments directly irrespective of whether insurer able to make reinsurance recoveries
- Reinsurance as exit strategy => insurer never totally tansfers risk due to reinsurer default risk

### Cost and availability

- Insurer will need to pay reinsurance premium
- Premium dependant on:
  - estimated cost of liabilites given precise structure of reinsurance
  - uncertainty around estimated cost
  - anticipated future investment return
  - costs of ongoing adminstration
  - capital required to support liabilities
  - financial strength of reinsurer
  - required return on capital (profit loading)
- Technical cost determined by actuaries
- Market forces (availablity of reinsurance) influences actual reinsurance premium
- Insurer can compare premium with current level of reserves held
  - Reinsurance premium paid out of current free reserves, if sizeable could jeopardise solvency

### Ongoing requirements

- Once reinsurance placed, insurer may have little future involvement in business
- Some involvement remains:
  - include business in regulatory reporting
  - regulatory capital assessment
- Some cases insurer required to continue to administer and settle all future claims itself, making reinsurance recoveries
  - Successful administration management difficult as level of claims activity decreases over time

## Commutation

- Commutation := insurance policy is cancelled, with agreement of both parties, such that no further claims can be made under the policy
  - Policyholder loses right to make any more claims in respect of either future or past periods of cover
- Commutations usually insurer-initiated approach to ending exposure
- Often employ active commutation programme in order to accelerate run-off business beyond what naturally occurs
  - Includes inwards and outwards business
  - Insurer pay policyholders to commute primary policies
  - Reinsurer pay insurer to commute its reinsurance policies
- Extreme scenario: company commutes all insurance policies such tath no claims remain outstanding and no further claims could be received
- In practice: only certain policies within portfolio commuted => limiting factor in exit strategy
- Insurer effects commutation, pays amount of money to policyholder in compensation for any future claims no longer payable under the insurance policy
- Policy buy-backs := insurer pays policyholder to lapse the policy
  - Commutation involving direct policy between insurer and policyholder
  - Commutation normally refers to termination of reinsurance contract
  - Terms are used interchangeably
- Effecting commutation, insurer releases itself from paying all future claims under the policy usually including those claims already notified but not yet paid
  - Reduces capital requirements and administration costs
- Policyholer's viewpoint:
  - commutation improves their current cashflow
  - commutation amount received > present value of future claims
- Likelihood of succesful commutation depends on ability of policyholder and insurer to reach agreement
  - Other exit strategies: either insurer does not need to reach agreement (e.g. `IBT`) or through alternative parties (e.g. reinsurance)
- Regulatory requirements: some insurance types cannot be commuted
  - Example: compulsory for policyholder to hold specific insurance

### Process

- Stages between policyholder and insurer to effect commutation
- Stage 1: Agree policy/policies to be commuted and current outstanding balances
  - Amounts due to be paid shortly
  - Any case reserves held
  - One insured may have several different policies if commercial arrangement
- Stage 2: Value ultimate liabilities under policies to be commuted
  - Including allowance for IBNeR and pure IBNR
  - Typically policyholder and insurer each perform own valuation
    - As commutation amount negotiated
    - Both parties determine own best estimate value of policies
- Stage 3: Parties negotiate consideration to be paid from insurer to policyholder to effect commutation
- Stage 4: Legal wording to effect commutation drafted and agreed

### Negotiation

- Level of uncertainty surrounding ultimate liabilities
  - High uncertainty => more likely future claims experience significantly deviate from valuation
  - Potential for adverse movements exceeds potential for favourable movement
  - Commutation consideration paid likely to exceed valuation of ultimate liabilitiesm especially where gerater uncertainty of ultime claims levels
  - Uncertainty typically greater for long-tailed classes
  - Long-tailed classes length of time before claims reported typically longer => estimate of IBNR greater and more difficult to predict
  - Long-tailed claims typically longer to settle => final settlement figure more uncertain
- Administration cost savings
  - Once commutation effected, insurer no longer has to carry out administration task in respect of origin policies => substantial cost savings
  - Savings significant when commutation programme results in no further policies remaining for particular LOB/portfolio/branch, e.g. fixed expenses can be removed more completely (e.g. claims handling department salaries)
  - Commutation consideration paid allows for such cost savings => higher commutation payment to insured
- Impact of future investment return
  - Commuting results in policyholder receiving sum of money now rather than possibility of claim payments in future
  - Depending on class, policyholder receives money many years earlier
  - Parties should consider future investment return on this sum of money
  - Positive impact on insured, negative impact on insurer => reduces commutation consideration
- Financial strength of insurer
  - Policyholder removes credit risk associated with holding insurance policy
  - Credit risk := risk future claim payments not (fully) paid by insurer or not paid in timely manner
    - Credit risk attached to insurance policy closely related to predicted future financial strength of insurer
  - Risk could be substantial as commutation may be motivated by solvency
  - Commutation consideration should allow for removal of credit risk
    - Amount depends on future predicted financial strength of insurer and time period claim payments expected
    - Where policyholder expects to receive claim payments over longer period of time => greater uncertainty over ability of insurer to meet such payments => more beneficial to receive certain amount money now
  - If insurer entered run-off typically it is at greater risk of insolvency => beneficial to policyholders to commute early to ensure pay-oput
    - However if risk of insolvency, regulators may restrict ability of insurers to carry out large-scale commutation if it risks causing insolvency
- Impact of outwards reinsurance where inwards contracts commuted
  - Insurer may commute insurance contracts which normally would make reinsurance recoveries as business is reinsured
  - When commuting policies reinsurer not necessarily required to pay its share of consideration paid to policyholder in resepect of commutation
    - Basic contract between insurer and policyholder, reinsurer is not a party of
  - Insurer will have separate negotiations with any reinsurers involved in policies being commuted
  - Alternatively insurer can commute outwards reinsurance prior to commuting inwards contracts
  - Some circumstances (reinsurance business), reinsurer looking to effect commutation may have insured same compay that it also purchased outwards reinsurance from => reinsurer look to effect an inwards and outwards commutation with relevant party

## Novation

- Novation := complete transfer of business from one insurer to another, with the agreement of all three parties (the policyholder, the old insurer and the new insurer)
- Novation replaces old insurer with new insurer, no contractual liability remains with old insurer
  - Old insurer makes an accompanying payment to new insurer
- Two insurers negotiate and agree novation amount across:
  - Valuation of ultimate liabilities
  - Uncertainty in ultimate liabilities
  - Administration costs / savings for each party
  - Impact of future investment return
  - Impact on outwards reinsurance
- Policyholder compares financial strength of two insurers and different levels of service provided
  - Some cases policyholder agrees novation to less financially strong insurer in exchange for compensation
- Successful novation requires agreement between three parties: policyholder, new insurer and old insurer
  - Agreement needs to be reached separately for every policy to be novated
  - Such agreement can be difficult to achieve
  - Novations typically seen where old and new insurer are within same group
- Regulators often restrict insurers' abilities to carry out large-scale novations of policies if viewed as attempt to cicumvent need to carry out an IBT which is subject to regulatory approval

## Insurance business transfer (`IBT`)

- IBT := complete transfer of business from one insurer to another such that no contractual liability remains with the original insurer
  - Process substitutes original insurer with the new insurer
  - Achieves exactly same result as novation
  - Can be effected for large number of policies at same time
  - Does not require agreement of policyholders
- As IBTs do not require consent of policyholders => strict regulatory requirements before company permitted to effect such a transfer
- EU Example: EU Directives prescribe minimum standards
  - Solvency certificate to be provided by local regulatory authority of transferee
- UK Example: Part VII transfer (from Part VII of Financial Services and Markets Act 2000)
- IE Example: Section 13 transfer (from Section 13 of the Assurance Companies Act 1909)
- Typically transfer approved by Courts with approval from relevant regulators and independent expert to conclude on effects on policyholders
- Policyholders often given opportunity to object to transfer
  - However if transfer has support of regulators and independent expert concludes not material effect on policyholders then likely to be approved
- IBT business can include liabilites and potential liabilites on current and expired policies
  - Exact business transferred depends on specific features of transfer, designed and agreed by companies involved with lawyers / advisors
  - Example: company transfers all its insurance business
  - Example: company transfers some of its insurance business
  - Example: business transfers to an existing company
  - Example: business transfers to a new empty company
- Usually significant disclosure requirements involved => costly
  - Example: communicate details of transaction to every policyholder
- Process for IBT varies by country
  - Example: requirement to appoint independent expert to opine on proposed transfer present in Part VII but not elsewhere
  - Situation outside EU varies, many countries have no Part VII equivalent

### Reasons for IBT

- Achieve finality
  - IBTs often undertaken to achieve true finality for transferor company
  - After transfer completed, transferor has no remaining exposure to transferred business
  - Cover for policyholders is maintained
- Cost savings
  - Many insurers have large number of different insurance companies in group (e.g. due to previous M&A)
  - IBT of legacy liabilities within companies can be transferred into one single company
  - Finality of transfer process enables other companies to be deregulated and wound up
  - Reduces management time and adminstration costs
    - Example: after transfer only one set of accounts, one set of regulatory returns required => significant cost savings
- Capital releases
  - Insurer releases capital from redundant subsidiaries and put it to more profitable uses
- M&A
  - Prior to acquisition: insurer transfers similiar portfolios into one entity ready to be sold
  - Prior to acquisition: insurer transfers portfolio out of company to enable sale of remaining business to progress
  - After acquisition: combining new subsidiaries to achieve cost savings and capital releases
  - Alternative way of acquiring portfolio(s) rather than purchasing entire company
- Restructuring overseas
  - Insurers can effect transfers to restructure business based in different jurisdictions
  - Example: company historically written business through overseas branch of local company now wants to set up full insurance company in that jurisdiction and wants to transfer business written by that branch
  - Enables companies to pursue business strategy (connected to tax, regulatory, capital, etc.) that might otherwise be hindered if still held run-off liabilities of transferred business

### Part VII Process

- Parties involved
  - Main parties are: transferor company, transferee company and policyholders
  - Involves regulator (PRA), lawyers and other experts
  - PRA approves independent expert appointment
  - PRA approves form of independent expert's report
  - PRA entitled to be heard in court
  - PRA produces report on proposed transfer for court
- Court hearings
  - Two court hearings:
    - Directions hearing
    - Sanction hearing
  - Directions hearing: court considers insurers' plans for publicising transfer (required to make policyholders aware of transfer)
    - Includes documents planned to be sent directly to policyholders
    - Includes plans for publishing notices in appropriate publications
    - Court considers granting insurer proposing transfer waivers from notifying certain policyholders
  - Sanction hearing: court asked to approve transfer
    - Usually shortly before desired effective date of transfer
  - Part VII transfers only go ahead if sanctioned by court
  - Before doing this court needs to be satisfied that transfer is appropriate
  - Court relies on opinions of PRA and independent expert
  - Court considers opinions of policyholders / other affected parties who object to proposed transfer
- Policyholder notification
  - Sufficient information to policyholders on transfer and its effects
  - Enables policyholders to decide if likely to be adversely affected
  - Enables policyholders to decide whether they wish to be heard in court
  - PRA approves in advance information sent to policyholders
    - Includes summary of independent expert's report
    - Full report available on request
  - Insurers give policyholders adequate time to consider information (usually at least 6 weeks)
  - Court can waive insurer notifying certain policyholders
    - Court bears in mind practicality and costs of sending notices to policyholders, effectiveness of other arrangements of informing policyholders
    - Court more likely to give waiver if cover expired policies and probability of policyholders making claim so small that sending them information is disproportionately expensive
  - Insurer usually take out press adverts to publicise scheme
    - Adverts important where policyholder records are incomplete
- Role of independent expert
  - Given opinion on likely effects of proposed transfer on affected policyholders
  - Produce report setting out this opinion
  - Ultimately responsible to courts
  - If involves long-term business, independent expert must be an actuary
  - If short-term no requirement although majority for non-life Part VII transfers conducted by actuary as independent expert

### IBT Considerations

- Effect on three main groups of policyholders:
  - Those retained in transferor company
  - Those proposed to be transferred from transferor company to transferee company
  - Existing policyholders of transferee company
- Some situations not all three groups exist
  - Example: if new company being established for purpose of receiving transfer => no existing policyholders in transferee company
- Some situations more than 3 groups of policyholders
  - Example: transfer where number of portfolios from different transferor companies transferred into one transferee company
- Insurer should investigate whether any policyholders left worse off after transfer than if no transfer across:
  - Security of policyholders' rights
  - Levels of service provided to policyholders

## Sale of business

- Sell whole company
  - Depends if buyer can be found and both parties can agree price
  - Achieves complete finality for seller
  - Only option where insurer wishes to cease writing complete portfolio of business
  - Where insurer ceases to write only portion of business cannot sell complete company => will effect alternative exit strategy
  - Prior to purchase, buyer undertakes due diligence to validate price agreed to pay for insurer
    - Ensure company being bought is as has been described
  - When buying company, purchaser assumes all liabilities of the company
    - Includes long-tail insurance policies sold years ago where level of exposure may be extremely uncertain
    - Some occasions seller required to retain some liabilites of sold company
    - Example: historical claims arising from specific uncertain event
  - Advantage of buying complete company: purchaser often make swift entry into market
    - Many of requirements (e.g. regulatory premissions) already in place
  - Disadvantages of sale of business from seller:
    - Reputational risk if sale managed poorly
    - Reputational risk if acquiring company handles things poorly after sale
- Sell other assets
  - Often considered by companies that have decided to exit portfolio and wish to maximise profitability
- Sell renewal rights to existing policies
  - Company ceases to underwrite LoB for which policies generally renewable
  - Details of policyholders valuable (perhaps cross-sell as well as renewal value)
  - Example: company underwrote large book of motor business but no longer wishes to do so
- Sell reinsurance assets
  - In respect of recoveries due from reinsurers
  - Identical to commutation agreement but rather effecting with reinsurer, company effects it with third party
  - Typically done when reinsurance recoveries are uncertain (amount/timing/both) as result of poor financial stregnth of reinsurer
  - Reinsured often willing to sell its reinsurance assets significantly below expected value if reinsurer was not financially impaired

## Regulation

- Many exit tools unlikely requires regulatory involvement
- Some sales that could create monopoly involves regulator with respect to anti-competition law
- Most significant regulatory involvement is in IBTs

### Regulator role

- In IBT, key concern is that each policyholder has adequate information and reasonable time within which to determine whether or not they are adversely affected and if so whether to make representations to court
- Regulator will act in way it considers most appropriate to advancing its own statutory objectives
- When IBT being considered, IBT promoters first approach regulator at early stage to enable regulator consider issues likely to arise and establish practical timetable for the IBT

### Independent expert

- Usual for procedures to require written submissions
  - Appointment of independent expert
  - Preparation of scheme report
- For P&C IBTs, independent expert normally competent at assessing technical provisions and uncertainties of liabilites they represent => actuary
  - Exceptionally where issues other than ability of transferee to meet liabilities to be transferred are more significant in assessing likely effects of scheme the criterion might not be applied
  - In this case independent expert expected to take advice from appropriately qualified practitioner about adequacy of financial resources of transferee
- Independent expert required to demonstrate sufficient independence from parties involved in transfer

### Scheme reports

- Regulators may wish scheme report addresses particular issues
- Regulator may want matters related to scheme / parties to transfer being drawn to independent expert's attention
  - Independent expert expected to contact regulators at early stage
- Independent expert still forms own opinion on such issues, may differ from regulators
- Important that report and conclusions are understandable to key readers: Courts & policyholders
  - Excessive technical actuarial analysis not included in report
    - May be necessary to provide this to regulators to gain their approval

  - Who appointed independent expert
  - Who is bearing costs of appointment
  - Confirmation independent expert approved / nominated by regulator
  - Statement of independent expert's professional qualifications

  - Outline of reasons behind each opinion expressed in report
  - Description of any reinsurance proposed should pass to transferee under scheme
    - Description of guarantees or additional reinsurance that will cover transferred business / business transferor will not be transferred
- Purpose := inform court => expert has duty to the court
  - Reliance placed on report by policyholders, reinsurers, regulators and others affected by scheme
- Amount of detail appropraite depends on complexity of scheme, materiality of details and circumstances
- Expert takes into account relevant legal, regulatory and professional guidance when preparing their report, e.g. [`APS X3`](professional.md#actuarial-profession-standards)

### Independent expert opinion

- Opinion on likely effects of scheme on policyholders
- Includes comparison of likely effects if implemented or not
- State whether considered alternative arrangements and if so what
- Where different groups of policyholders likely affected differently by scheme, comment on those material differences to policyholders and views on:
  - effect of scheme on security of policyholders' contractual rights, likelihood and potential effects of insolvency of insurer
  - likely effects of scheme on investment management, new business strategy, administration, claims handling, expense levels and valuation bases with respect to how affect:
    - security of policyholders' contractual rights
    - levels of service provided to policyholders
    - for long-term insurance: reasonable expectations of policyholders
    - cost and tax effects of scheme in how affect security of policyholders' contractual rights and reasonable expectations
