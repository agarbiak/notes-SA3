## Latent claims characteristics

- Latent claims := claims arising from a risk not specifically allowed for by the underwriter when selling / pricing the original policy
  - Sometimes used to describe any claim where there is a long delay between the original exposure and the manifestation of the claim
  - Example: Industrial deafness classed as latent yet well understood and known to be covered by UK employers' liability policies
- Mean latency period := average time between original exposure and subsequent manifestation of the disease/claim
  - Example: Mesothelioma has latency period of 30-40 years
- Often bodily injury, many times in respect of occupational exposure to material/repetitive working practice that gives rise to injury/disease after long period of time from first exposure
  - Example: Vibration white finger := industrial injury triggered by continuous use of vibrating hand-held machinery which affects blood vessels, nerves, muscles, joints of hand, wrist and arms
- Also possible in pharmacological treatments - side effects which take many years to emerge / for side effect to be causally linked to treatment
  - Example: Thalidomide sedative drug, sold 1957-1961, withdrawn after found to cause birth defects
- Also physical damage - example: US environmental pollution clean-up costs
  - Claims involve costs incurred by companies being required by retrospective legislation to clean up certain sites which post human health / environmental hazard - companies involved typically dumped waste material at sites many years earlier

## Latent claim stages

- 4 stages of latent claim development:
  - Stage 1 Unknown - policy covering risk in question accepted but identity of latent claim not yet known
  - Stage 2 Potential - info about possible identity of claim type emerges but no clear link/liability proven
    - Example: link between proximity to power cables exposure and leukaemia
  - Stage 3 Emerging - claim type emerged as latent claim but full extent of liability still developing
    - Example: asbestos-related claims in US and UK
  - Stage 4 Emerged / Closed - latent claim type occured and fully developed with no more exposure or still emerging but in predictable way that can be allowed for when policies underwritten
    - Example: Industrial deafness, Coal miners' black lung
- Each stage need to estimate reserves, regulatory capital and risk premium required in event business is commuted / transferred to another insurer

**Stage 1 - Unknown**

- Existence of claims uknown => considerable uncertainty => basic methodology
- Reserves estimate: start with original pricing basis (no other actual info) and modify this as time passes and no latent claims emerge if believe total expecte value of latent claims lower than initially allowed for
- Approach only works if reserved portfolio included an explicit pricing allowance for future unknown latent claim types
  - If not the case then more ad hoc process has to be applied

**Stage 2 - Potential**

- May able to infer liability estimates based on size of historical latent claims and possibly specific info related to claim type
- Liability may not have been demonstrated
- Insurers may have number of legal defences
- Appropriate to estimate probability of winning legal arguments as part of liability estimation

**Stage 3 - Emerging**

- Legal liability better established and better information about potential extent of claims
- Two methods to estimate quantum of liability
  - Top down
  - Bottom up
- Reconile results of both methods to derive single estimate
- Top down: produce global estimate of liability to economy / insurance industry => estimate proportion of this attributable to insurer
  - Take into account: insurer's policy terms, excesses and limits
  - Example: bodily injury type claims, able to make population-wide estimate of total number of claims using epidemiological models - multiply this by expected average claim cost => total insurance injury loss estimate => apply this to insurer's market share of LoB
- Bottom up: review policies written by insurer to determine which are exposed to latent claim type taking into account cover dates, perils covered, exclusions
- Estimate liability for each insured (top down / other method): potentially different scope for production and aggregate cost of latent claims => allocate to proportion of coverage provided by insurer
- Assumptions about manner in which claim allocated between various years of coverage and various insurance policies providing cover in each year
- Credibility of estimate by either method impaired by:
  - Changes to legal environment - number of legal rulings / legislative changes have increased insurance industry's liability in respect of US & UK asbestos-related claim exposures
  - Incomplete policy records - unable to estimate true extent of liability
  - Changes to propensity to claim - claimants more aware of injury type and legal rights => propensity to claim tends to increase
  - Increased longevity - case of bodily injury, latent claims more likely for people who live longer => increases in longevity gives increase in number of latent claims
- Credit for reinsurance if scenarios under which losses impact outwards reinsurance coverage
- Another method: paid survival ratio approach (insurer's average annual payments x selected survival ratio)
  - Survival ratio := number of years existing reserves will last assuming annual paid claims continue at current level (no additional reserving)
    - Aggressive payment strategy => artificially low survival ratio
    - Deferring paying claims => artificially high survival ratio

## Underwriting latent hazards

- At pricing stage identify potential of risk to give rise to latent claims by:
  - Historical rate at which latent claims have emerged from class of business
    - Example: liability classes far more likely to give rise to latent claims than property classes
    - Due to liability policy wording => wide coverage => perils not uniquely defined
    - Some property classes include small amount of liability cover, example: UK domestic household includes some public liability cover
  - Nature of insurance cover provided, losses occurring basis far more likely to give rise to latent claims than coverage on same risk provided on claims made basis
    - As injuries giving rise to latent claims generally long time to manifest by which time too late to claim for claims made policy
    - Some jurisdictions: claims made basis not permitted
  - Exclusions within policy wording, e.g. absolute pollution exclusion clauses
  - Industry being covered - pharmaceutical industry more likely to give rise to latent claims than other industries
    - This is mitigated by changing working practices and improved risk management over time
  - Territory - North America has seen largest mass tort latent claims emerged to date
    - Significant latent claims occurred in UK, Continental Europe and Australia
    - Mass tort := civil action involving number of plaintiffs (== claimants) against one / few corporate defendants

## Asbestos

- Asbestos is a fibrous substance that occurs naturally and is mined
  - The fibres are very fine, easily become airborne and are easily breathed in
- There are a number of forms of asbestos with slightly different properties, but they are all understood to be hazardous to health, albeit to different degrees
- Industrially useful property - ability to withstand heat, many applications would be the ideal material except for its danger to health
- Asbestos banned for most uses in the developed world
  - Specified procedures for safe handling and disposal
  - Still in heavy use in the developing world
- Once inhaled, not readily expelled by the body
- The asbestos fibres cause the body to respond in various ways
- Asbestosis (== pneumoconiosis) most common condition:
  - scarring of the lung tissue that reduces the lung’s efficiency
  - not normally fatal
  - likelihood of contracting is related to the amount of asbestos inhaled
  - term _asbestosis_ sometimes (incorrectly) used to refer to all asbestos-related diseases
  - some policy wordings contain asbestosis exclusions with clear intention being to exclude all asbestos-related diseases
- Mesothelioma is most serious, less frequent, condition caused by asbestos
  - cancer, normally fatal within two years of diagnosis
  - not understood to be dose-dependent,
  - in theory can be caused by a single asbestos fibre
  - most significant insured loss form of asbestos-related disease as compensation awards higher than for other asbestos-related diseases
  - typical amount awarded to mesothelioma claimant is a key assumption for estimating future asbestos-related costs
  - awards in the US tend to be much larger than those in the UK
- Pleural plaques show up on X-rays and CT scans but not believed to cause any impairment of lung or any other function
  - non-symptomatic effects are not always deemed eligible for compensation
  - insurers have not, in general, been greatly affected by such claims
  - however the law is continually developing in all jurisdictions
- Person injured by asbestos may have a large number of companies that they can try to sue for compensation
  - Often difficult to pin down exactly when an asbestos-related disease was contracted or which exposure gave rise to the disease
  - Example: someone whose job involved working with asbestos probably worked for a number of different employers
- Further information in the 2004 GIRO working party paper: [UK asbestos – the definitive guide](https://www.actuaries.org.uk/system/files/documents/pdf/Lowe_0.pdf)

## Pollution

- Pollution := introduction of contaminants that cause instability, harm or discomfort to the environment
  - Even water can be a pollutant e.g. in fuel systems
- Many industrial processes can pollute the environment
- Significant insurance problem first in the US
- Evidence some US businesses were aware of their polluting activity effect but as science has advanced more problems have emerged
- The law (common law or statute law) in most developed countries attaches liability to those who cause damage to the property of others
- From insurance point of view - predictable pollution caused by ongoing activities is a _known loss_ and is not insurable, a point which courts may be asked to rule on
  - Example of predictable pollution: if a chemical plant has an agreement with the water authorities to eject part-treated chemicals into the sea
- Key drivers of insured claims experience:
  - Potential for long reporting delays
    - Contamination can occur for long period of time before effects become apparent
  - Clean up costs very expensive
  - Legal suits typically brought against biggest polluter => has to pursue recoveries from other polluters
  - Pollution claims much more important in US
    - Doubtless developments elsewhere in future
  - Landmark legal rulings have significant effect

## Health hazards

- Covers a wide range of dangers to health
- Asbestos is a health hazard but as so large regarded as a special case
- Large proportion of health hazard claims arise out of drugs that have caused unexpected damage
  - Example: diethylstilbestrol (_"DES"_), a drug to reduce the likelihood of miscarriages but linked to genital abnormalities in daughters
- Number of diseases associated with industrial processes are health hazards
  - Example: diseases associated with coal mining - black lung disease (coal workers’ pneumoconiosis)
  - Example: ingestion of many kinds of dust generated by commercial processes
- Some health hazards regarded as having been intended to be covered from the outset
  - Example: product liability cover granted to drug companies
  - DES claims were not expected but claims against drug companies are always a possibility
- The range of potential health hazards is large
- For most (re)insurers claims for asbestos and pollution typically dwarf those for health hazards currently
  - It is not impossible that a health hazard of which the industry is currently unaware could develop to be very expensive and financially very damaging in the future

## Future latent claims

- Reserving methods:
  - Apply simple multiplier to other reserves
  - Use benchmark (e.g. industry body, UK Health and Safety Executive)
  - Frequency / severity approach
  - Top-down approach
  - Bottom-up approach
  - IFoA 1999 paper on [reserving for unknown liabilities](https://www.actuaries.org.uk/system/files/documents/pdf/unknownliab.pdf)
- Number of cases unsuccessfully tested in US courts
  - Some dismissed, some settled cheaply out of court
  - Examples: silica (sand, base for cosmetics), manganese (welding rods), polychlorinated biphenyls (used in coolant fluid), methly tertiary butyl ether (caused by oil tank leakage) and tobacco
- Sexual abuse claims against churches, religious schools and in media
  - Such claims have very long latency period
- Long passage from _infection_ to full claim status
- New latent scenarios always envisaged in product liability arena
  - Example: pharmaceutical company and future thalidomide
- Possibilities exist with:
  - electromagnetic fields (e.g. living near power cables)
  - nanotechnology (used in sunscreen, toothpastes, etc.)
  - climate change (rising sea levels cause damage)
  - lifestyle risk (obesity, alcoholism)
  - noise
  - mobile phones
  - pesticides
- Exclusions and instructive advice in place (to cover unknowns)
  - Supposed future losses not in claims but in legal cost in defending manufacturer / its insurer
  - => Policy wordings critical
  - Insurer needs to know precisely the jurisdictions exposed to
- Insurer seek impose limited reporting periods
- Reinsurance protection is high priority in managing uncertainty
- Future latent claims is **where**, not if/when
  - Asbestos still extensively used in Brazil, Russia, India, China and Indonesia

## Modelling latent claims

- Quantify uncertainty in cost of latent claims for:
  - Reserve ranges for management information
  - Calculating risk margin (SII)
  - Use in capital model for capital requirements
  - Reinsurance planning
  - Investment and asset-liability modelling
  - Pricing
  - M&A
- Use full stochastic model (simulation-based) or deterministic scenario based approach, appropriateness depends on:
  - Purpose
  - Availability of data
  - Stage of claims development
  - Materiality of exposure
  - Cost of developing model
- Example: if capital modelling, stochastic approach needed to produce full distribution of outcomes
- Example: simpler deterministic approach sufficient for determining interval range for management information
- Emerging stage latent claims / known disease claims: likely relevant data available => complex / data-driven modelling approach could be used
- Unknown / potential stage latent claims: models require more subjective approaches
  - What-if scenarios
  - Brainstorming
- Reserve risk: Stochastic model for latent claims risk needs to consider process uncertainty, parameter uncertainty and model uncertainty
  - Process uncertainty: random occurrence of new latent claim type
  - Parameter uncertainty: rate of new claim types, significant as limited data on which to base assumptions
- Capital model: consider interactions and dependencies with other business areas
  - Example: links due to general propensity for policyholders to claim
    - Impacts claims experience in other parts of the portfolio
  - Knock on implications of latent claims for other risk types across operational risk (claims handling issues), reinsurance credit and reinsurance dispute risks
- Very long-term nature of latent claims => impact of inflation and economic factors more significant than other loss types
  - Modelling these factors requires attention, especially if not modelled for other claim types
- Model needs validating
  - Purpose of model imposes requirements on type and level of validation required
  - Example: if latent claims model part of internal model for SII, validation requirements for such model to satisfy SII requirements
  - If stochastic model used => deterministic scenarios could be used as validation test of model
- Exercise highly subjective, significant use of expert judgement
  - Results sensitive to key assumptions
  - => Important to identify key assumptions, including _hidden_ assumptions e.g. assumptions of independence
  - Sensitivity test assumptions
  - Uncertainty in results communicated to recipients of analysis
