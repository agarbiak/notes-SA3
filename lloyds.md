## Overview of Lloyd's

- Lloyd's Act of 1871
- Market framework within which insurance conducted by members
- Historically not an insurer in its own right -> no insurance risk
- Lloyd's of London established Lloyd's Brussels (Lloyd's Insurance Company S.A.)
  - Ability to write insurance business within the EEA
  - Authorised and regulated by National Bank of Belgium
  - All non-EEA business written in same way -> business insured directly with members
  - Business written though Lloyd's Brussels insured by Lloyd's Brussels and 100% reinsured by syndicates with Lloyd's -> continues protection benefit by Lloyd's capital structure

### Annual Venture

- Mechanism that allows investors (members) to provide capital to UWers for a year at a time
- Each annual venture := Year of Account (`YOA`)
- Legal basis of activities
- Most insurance companies are **vertically integrated**, at Lloyd's different entities take on some roles and extra participant - the Corporation of Lloyd's
- Participants at Lloyd's include **underwriting members** (== `Names`, == `members`)
  - Members are insurers for a Lloyd's policy but take no active part in process
  - Member role is to subscribe to a **syndicate** := collection of one or more members who agreed to back UWing activities of particular UWer (:= **active underwriter**) for one specific calendar year by holding capital at Lloyd's (:= `Funds at Lloyd's`)
- Profits/liabilities from that year's insurance activities allocated to members on **several basis** (:= each member's profit/loss their own, member not liabile for other member's liabilities) in proportion to agreed participation at start of year
- Members do not directly employ UWers / staff
- Syndicate itself has no legal status := shorthand for collection of participating members
- **Managing agent** operates each syndicate, can operate several syndicates, each syndicate has one managing agent
- Syndicates usually re-form each year, referenced by numbers
- Members of syndicate primarily companies (== `corporate members`), some private individuals (private members - limited/unlimited liability), some both.
- Corporate members must be separate legal entities from management agent, often owned by same insurance group
- In aggregate, across Lloyd's, corporate members are vast majority of participants
- Managing agents are **agents** of members on their syndicates -> must act in interests of members, duties extend well beyond normal commercial contract
- No new unlimited liability private members are admitted, existing number remain very small.
- Corporate members have limited liability - can only collect up to amount of capital deposited with Lloyd's
- Each year if syndicate is to be re-formed in following year, current members have right to re-subscribe same proportion of next syndicate. If they do not want to, they can sell right to highest bidder in an auction (== `capacity auction`)
- Growth of corporate membership, insurance groups bought up all participation rights in number of syndicates
  - ILVs (**Integrated Lloyd's Vehicles**) := syndicate in which all participants owned by one company/group
  - Lloyd's allows ILVs to behave like companies - allowing them to hold some capital either in syndicate or in corporate member
- PRA regulates whole of LLoyd's and each managing agent, does not separately regulate members, although collects some info directly from individual syndicates

**Equitas**

- All of Lloyd's liabilites up to the end of 1992 were Part VII transferred into Equitas in 2009
- Those liabilites are reinsured & managed by National Indemnity Company and Resolute Management Services Ltd, both part of Berkshire Hathaway
- Established to manage liabilites arising from 1992 and prior YOAs, not authorised to write new business

### Syndicate operation

- Syndicate remains open beyond end of the UWY -> syndicate continues to exist, members still bound, ceases to accept risks
- Syndicates **must** remain open at least until end of 3rd year
  - Members cannot leave the syndicate
  - Profits remain in the syndicate (some profits can be released under certain conditions)
- Syndicate contains **Premiums Trust Funds** (`PTFs`) := running balance of premiums received, claims paid out, investment income received and expenses paid out
  - As claim payments required <- managing agent pays them out of PTFs
  - If syndicate needs more cash to make payments <- agent make **cash call** on members who provide share of requirement within specified period
- Syndicate liabilites assessed twice annually (H1 and YE)
  - YE assessment supported by actuarial review, Statement of Actuarial Opinion (`SAO`)
- If at any time syndicate's unpaid liabilities exceeed remaining PTFs => solvency shortfall
  - Part / all members' capital treated as used up -> member may require deposit further capital with Lloyd's
- End of 3rd year, syndicate allowed to close
  - Once closed, ceases to exist, members of syndicate have no further association with it
  - At closure -> profits distributed amongst Names
  - Outstanding solvency shortfalls give rise to cash calls to fund the RITC
  - Portfolio of policies continue to generate claim payments on existing/newly notified claims (sometimes for years later) -> to ensure claims can be met and an etity to pay them, syndicate closes after paying an RITC

### RITC

- RITC allows investors to pass run-off liabilities to a willing buyer if one can be found
- Two functions:
  - Reinsurance of all liabilities for a premium usually settled in terms of assets including outwards RI cover
  - Delegation to the reinsurer to manage day-to-day of syndicate
- Process subject to Lloyd's Chain of Security, three links:
  - Syndicate level assets (PTF) - held in trust, benefit of PHers whose contracts underwritten by relevant member
  - Members' funds at Lloyd's (`FAL`) - held in trust, benefit of PHers
  - Central assets - mutual assets held by Corporation available, subject to Council approval, to meet member's insurance liabilites
- If chain fails then reinsured members liable
  - The RITC allow members to take 100% of the RI as asset in their solvency tests, thus release when all years closed their FAL
- The need to maintain chain of security means almost all RITCs carried out by Lloyd's syndicates
- Under RITC, managing agent of ceding syndicate calculates amount appropriate to meet all future liabilites & expenses. Managing agent of receiving syndicate makes same assessment
  - Managing agents legally agents of members of syndicates they operate => must represent interests of thsoe memebers, need to ensure RITC is fair
- Normal case: receiving syndicate successor syndicate of closing syndicate
  - Example: YOA 2020 Syndicate 123 will close at 31 December 2022, YOA 2021 of Syndicate 123 will be receiving syndicate
- Syndicate requires audit opinion in closing YOA

**Inability to conclude RITC**

- Fundamental uncertainty
  - Some of liabilites/outstanding exposures at end of 36 monhts still very uncertain of outcome
    - Large unresolved RI disputes
    - Claims under dispute
    - Influx of many late claims
    - Potential RI failures
    - 9/11 attacks (precented syndicates closing at end of 2003)
  - Audit report will indicate fundamental uncertainty prevents RITC
  - SAO will alos indicate extreme uncertainty / qualified
  - After passage of time, uncertainty resolved, RITC possible 1+ years later <- syndicate remains open in meantime
- Lack of receiving syndicate
  - Syndicates continue year after year / merged into other syndicate => provides natural receiving syndicate
  - Sometimes syndicates not renewed (e.g. not commercially successful) => no natural receiving syndicate
  - If not renewed, often experience of last 1+ YOAs bad => **orphan** syndicates contain run-off of bad portfolios of risk => hard to find syndicate that accepts the RITC
  - As orphan snydicates settled claim, managing agents found receiving syndicates to accept in years following
  - Authorities gave Centrewrite permission to accept RITC to increase **commerical RITC** marketplace := RITC into receiving syndicates unrelated to ceding orphan syndicate

**RITC system**

- Prior years are telescoped into oldest open syndicate (up to YOA 1993, prior to 1993, all in Equitas)
- 2021 syndicate has:
  - 2021 YOA, 2020 YOA == **pure**, 2019 YOA \{1993, ... 2019 YOAs\}
- Lloyd's analyses past data by pure year := underwriting year of original syndicate
- Use RITC matrix to identify correct syndicate to allocate experience
  - Shows how particular syndicates have RITCs into others (commercial RITC or through syndicate merges)

### Subscription market

- Subscription business := (re)insurance written on a co-insurance basis
  - Whole risk divided up proportionally, each (re)innsurer takes specified share of premium and claims
  - Insured look to each co-insurer only to extent of its share
  - Failure to pay by one co-insurer does not affect liabilities of any others
- **Placing** slip - broker document, summary of terms of proposed (re)insurance contract, presented to selected UWers for their consideration - who may delete/amend/add terms on slip to give indication/quotation
- **Signing** slip - broker document, after quotation accepted to process premiums under contract evidenced by placing slip. Cleaned up version of final placing slip, shows UWers' stamps, signed lines, UWing references - inserted by each UWer at request of broker
- Placing slip can be used as signing slip - needs to show UWers' stamps, signed lines and UWing references
- **Lead underwriter** - first person seen (normally establiashed expert in that field), takes large (largest) share of risk
  - Agrees wordings
  - Agrees price
  - Decides whether claim paid or whether resisted => follow underwriters must pay if lead agrees
  - Highly skilled, actively manage book, reputation/expertise influences follow UWers
  - Costs more to lead, gives leader control of claims negotiation and settlement process
  - Some classes, lead UWer paid more, more support staff to carry out analysis, especially vertical placements (e.g. aviation)
- **Follow underwriter** - rest of UWers on slip are follow UWers
  - Often: Uwers focus on leading / folowing, same for syndicates
  - Judge careffuly which leaders to follow, leaders need reputation amongst peers (their competitors)
  - Brokers unlikely to show leaders risk as lead if it will be hard to fill up the slip with well-rated followers
- Consequence of subscription market for actuaries:
  - Clarify whether data represents 100% of risk or respective UWer's share
  - Usually: data relating to premiums and claims will be for share
  - Usually: information on XS points, layers, etc. will be at 100% level
  - Actuary convert into common basis (100%) for calcs and back to % share for results => simple but easily generate errors / misunderstanding
  - To get info (especially claims) need to contact the lead (or broker)
  - Face-to-face market => politics and UWer led culture prevails

## Regulation at Lloyd's

- Lloyd's maintains central assets for solvency
- Mutual capital at discretion of Council of Lloyd's usable to pay Pher claims if members unable to (FAL is exhausted)
- Central Assets for Solvency composed of
  - New Central Fund
  - other central assets
  - subordinated debt
- Lloyd's capital assessed at 3 levels:
  - Overall Lloyd's
  - Syndicate
  - Member

### Capital requirements for Lloyd's

- Lloyd's regulated by PRA => subject to SII
- Lloyd's completed the Internal Model Approval Process (`IMAP`)
  - Lloyd's IM approved
- Lloyd's SCR covers:
  - risks members exposed to
  - additional risk Society of Lloyd's exposed to
- Lloyd's required to identify central requirement that covers risks to which only Society is exposed
- Lloyd's capital:
  - New Central Fund (`NCF`)
    - Cash
    - Investments
    - Proceeds of subordinated debt instruments
  - other central assets
- Lloyd's required to be solvent at all times
  - Lloyd's reassess solvency position half-yearly
  - If PRA request - reassessment of solvency position at any time (e.g. following major loss scenario)
- PRA's solvency test applied to aggregate of all members' exposures
  - Assets available = FAL + central assets
- Lloyd's must demonstrate central assets sufficient to cover total of all members' solvency deficits
  - Own funds comply with tiering requirements

### Capital requirements for Syndicates

- Lloyd’s uses data from individual syndicates as part of the parameterisation of the model
  - through regulatory returns managing agencies complete for each syndicate they manage
- Syndicate Business Forecast (`SBF`) and Lloyd’s Capital Return (`LCR`) are submitted by managing agencies to Lloyd’s every September
  - SBF contains breakdown about business syndicate plans to write in the next YoA
  - LCR contains information about SCR which the managing agency views as appropriate for syndicate based on projected run-off of open YoAs and planned future business in the SBF
- Discussions on SBF held with Lloyd’s prior to completing returns, draft submission made in July
  - Post submissions, Lloyd’s review team come back with questions, may request agency submits another return
  - LCR submission required in September alongside the capital model validation report
  - LCR for non-aligned syndicates must be approved prior to the capacity auctions
    - where Names may buy and sell these rights to subscribe to syndicates
    - so have an earlier approval deadline than the aligned syndicates
- Managing agents required to submit capital numbers on 2 bases:
  - One-year SCR is SII consistent, looks at risks emerging over the next twelve months
  - Ultimate SCR looks at the adverse development until all liabilities have been paid
- The ultimate SCR used by Lloyd’s to set the capital for each syndicate
  - Loadings applied by Lloyd’s if they feel capital number proposed for syndicate is insufficient
  - If load applied, agency can appeal
  - Final number uplifted by 35% to maintain Lloyd’s credit rating := Economic Capital Assessment (`ECA`)
  - ECA := amount of capital that is required to back the syndicate
- Managing agency must get the syndicate’s IM approved by Lloyd’s
  - PRA supervises the process by which Lloyd’s reviews the ultimate SCRs
  - PRA option to carry out a review of a syndicate SCR
- Lloyd’s issues updated guidance annually
  - Sets out the requirements
  - Sets out minimum standards expected by Lloyd’s
  - Offers detailed advice on how to carry out various aspects of the SCR
- After Lloyd’s set a syndicate’s SCR => allocates capital to the Lloyd’s Names backing the syndicate based on participation
  - This is amount of capital that Name is required to put up
  - It is the members, not the syndicates who are required to be solvent

### Capital requirements for Names

**Funds at Lloyd's** (`FAL`)

- Each member provides amount of capital specified by Lloyd's
  - Capital held in trust
  - Lloyd's has absolute authority to use it to pay claims / other liabilities arising from member's activities at Lloyd's
  - Capital fund of member := FAL
- FAL lodged in 2 ways:
  - Physical assets
  - Letter of Credit (`LoC`)
    - Guarantees by banks to provide funds when called upon by Lloyd's
    - Lloyd's centrally has unconstrained power to call guarantee (drawdown LoC) whenever it wishes (in practice to meet liabilities / maintain capital)
  - Must meet Lloyd's admissibility criteria => equivalent to criteria applied by PRA to UK insurance companies prior to SII
- LoCs for FAL must meet:
  - Appropriate level of rating of bank
  - Available throughout specified period, usually 4 years, **evergreen**
    - **Evergreen LoC** := expiry date with provision to automatically extend until issuing banks informs beneficiary of final expiry
    - Approved as ancillary own funds
  - LoCs available at low cost by collateralising them with other assets
    - Using LoCs as FAL exploits **double use of assets** - obtain normal investment returns on assets while using them as collateral to reduce cost of LoC
    - Banks charge rate for LoC that reflects investment risk of collateral assets
    - Arrangement provides members with great flexibility
    - Lloyd's centrally fulled protected by terms of LoC
- FAL only needed for open YoAs
  - Held at member level, not YoA level
  - Member holds single FAL to cover risks of all their open years
- Diversification credit for member participation on multiple syndicates

**Lloyd's SCR**

- Detailed simulation model used to simulate member experience
  - Correlation between members included
- Simulation output: overall distribution of losses beyond FAL derived
  - Lloyd's Society SCR calculated as central assets such that probability of being inadequate = 0.5%
- Lloyd's SCR calculated on one-year SCR basis two ways:
  - Market Wide SCR (`MWSCR`) := all capital consumed at 1 in 200, whatever source
  - Central SCR (`CSCR`) := central capital needed at 1 in 200
- MWSCR includes CSCR
  - VaR nature => 1 in 200 event for whole market different from 1 in 200 for central assets
  - MWSCR directly comparable with SCRs for other insurers
- Economic capital central capital assessment made for in ORSA
  - Materially higher level of capital than CSCR

**Minimum FAL**

- Min FAL := 40% of member's Overall Premium Income Limit (`OPIL`) == member capacity
  - Premium := gross of RI, net of brokerage
  - OPIL := Sum{respective syndicate capacity \* members share}
- Syndicate capacity approved as part of business plan approval process
  - Maximum premium syndicate permitted to underwrite in year
- Min FAL reduced to 25% for some personal lines business
  - Where poses uncompetitive capital burden
  - Where produces higher capital than required on risk based assessment
  - Member obtains waiver only if >=85% risks are EU personal lines

**In Line**

- Members tested twice a year to check **in line**
- Member is **in line** := if FAL >= Lloyd's capital requirement
- Subject to min 40% of member's capacity (max gross RI, net commission premium allowed to undewrite in current year)
- Generally capital required to be **in line** > PRA's solvency requirement of a firm

**Solvency deficits and surpluses**

- Member solvency deficit := liabilites (including claims reserves + IBNR) in open sydnicate > PTFs of syndicate
- No immediate need for extra cash => no cash call
- Solvency deficits counted against members' FAL
- Solvency surpluses counted in favour of FAL
- Member can cease to be in line
  - If large losses => ceases to meet PRA's solvency test
  - Member required to deposit further assets into FAL
  - If FAL insufficient to meet PRA test => central assets earmarked to demonstrate member's solvency

**Coming into line** (`CIL`)

- No longer in line := member whose FAL (less solvency deficits) < Lloyd's FAL requirement
- Lloyd's power to require member to lodge further assets at any time => come back into line
  - Agrees to carry out process twice a year in normal conditions
- November:
  - members who wish to underwrite in following year must CIL (main exercise)
  - solvency position assessed as at projected year-end (review carried out in preceding September)
  - if known liabilities increased since last solvency calc, Lloyd's expect members to show sufficient assets available to CIL as soon as liabilites recognised
- June: all active members must lodge assets if ceased to be in line
- Between: Lloyd's expects member to maintain FAL >= ultimate SCR level
- Lloyd's sanction members who are not in line: limit / stop underwriting
  - If member ceases undewriting of own accord => Lloyd's cannot compel them to lodge further FAL
- Syndicate only allowed to undewrite from 1 January following year if all members in line

### Statement of Actuarial Opinion (`SAO`)

- Year end, each open syndicate YoA requires SAO
- SAOs produced under Lloyd's valuation of liabilities rules
  - Covered by actuarial guidance: TASs and ASPs
- SAO reports covered under same guidance
  - Actuarial profession: Advisory Notes on ULAE, bad debt, large loss wordings
- Actuaries signing SAOs must hold signing actuary certificate issued by IFoA
- SII regime: Lloyd's and each managing agent required to appoint Chief Actuary
  - If no SAO for any open year => Lloyd's requires its Chief Actuary to provide equivalent opinion
- SAOs include earned results on both gross and net of RI basis
- Gross opinions must allow for Unallocated Loss Adjustment Expenses (`ULAE`)
- Net opinions must allow for bad/doubtful debt on expected RI recoveries
- Opinion is **one way** test
  - Certifies earned Tps opined on at least as large as actuary's best estimate
  - Best estimate := mean expected outcome
- Opinions can contain additional comments on uncertainty
  - Comment on large events / circumstances that increase uncertainty of estimates
- Lloyd's require completion of SAO template - provides additional info including:
  - Declaring earned margin between signing actuary and booked estimate
  - Amount of profit signing actuary estimates is within unearned premium
  - Used to inform level of earned margin and profit in UPR for SII TPs
- Each SAO supported by formal actuarial report addressed to managing agents
  - Copy to Lloyd's
- Syndicates writing US business required to hold assets in specific US trust funds
  - Liabilites for Credit for Reinsurance Trust Fund
  - Liabilites for Surplus Lines Trust Fund
  - Both subject to actuarial opinion as required by US regulators
- Preparation of US trust funds opinions covered by actuarial guidance APS G2
  - Provided by an actuary that holds signing actuary certificate from IFoA
  - Liabilities based on gross losses using _Modified UK Basis_

### Audit opinion

- Syndicates require an audit opinion on the financial statements of the syndicate for each open year of account
- Auditor providing opinion may place reliance on the SAO
  - In practice cannot legally place reliance on this
  - Must form their own opinion
- Opinions form part of the annual reporting process managing agencies undertake for syndicates they manage
  - Contains accounting, financial and other information items which are aggregated into Lloyd's statements and returns
