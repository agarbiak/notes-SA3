## Lloyd's

- Lloyd's Act of 1871
- Market framework within which insurance conducted by members
- Historically not an insurer in its own right -> no insurance risk
- Lloyd's of London established Lloyd's Brussels (Lloyd's Insurance Company S.A.)
  - Ability to write insurance business within the EEA
  - Authorised and regulated by National Bank of Belgium
  - All non-EEA business written in same way -> business insured directly with members
  - Business written though Lloyd's Brussels insured by Lloyd's Brussels and 100% reinsured by syndicates with Lloyd's -> continues protection benefit by Lloyd's capital structure

### Annual Venture

- Mechanism that allows investors (members) to provide capital to UWers for a year at a time
- Legal basis of activities
- Most insurance companies are **vertically integrated**, at Lloyd's different entities take on some roles and extra participant - the Corporation of Lloyd's
- Participants at Lloyd's include **underwriting members** (== `Names`, == `members`)
  - Members are insurers for a Lloyd's policy but take no active part in process
  - Member role is to subscribe to a **syndicate** := collection of one or more members who agreed to back UWing activities of particular UWer (:= **active underwriter**) for one specific calendar year by holding capital at Lloyd's (:= `Funds at Lloyd's`)
- Profits/liabilities from that year's insurance activities allocated to members on **several basis** (:= each member's profit/loss their own, member not liabile for other member's liabilities) in proportion to agreed participation at start of year
- Members do not directly employ UWers / staff
- Syndicate itself has no legal status := shorthand for collection of participating members
- **Managing agent** operates each syndicate, can operate several syndicates, each syndicate has one managing agent
- Syndicates usually re-form each year, referenced by numbers
- Members of syndicate primarily companies (== `corporate members`), some private individuals (private members - limited/unlimited liability), some both.
- Corporate members must be separate legal entities from management agent, often owned by same insurance group
- In aggregate, across Lloyd's, corporate members are vast majority of participants
- Managing agents are **agents** of members on their syndicates -> must act in interests of members, duties extend well beyond normal commercial contract
- No new unlimited liability private members are admitted, existing number remain very small.
- Corporate members have limited liability - can only collect up to amount of capital deposited with Lloyd's
- Each year if syndicate is to be re-formed in following year, current members have right to re-subscribe same proportion of next syndicate. If they do not want to, they can sell right to highest bidder in an auction (== `capacity auction`)
- Growth of corporate membership, insurance groups bought up all participation rights in number of syndicates
  - ILVs (**Integrated Lloyd's Vehicles**) := syndicate in which all participants owned by one company/group
  - Lloyd's allows ILVs to behave like companies - allowing them to hold some capital either in syndicate or in corporate member
- PRA regulates whole of LLoyd's and each managing agent, does not separately regulate members, although collects some info directly from individual syndicates

**Equitas**

- All of Lloyd's liabilites up to the end of 1992 were Part VII transferred into Equitas in 2009
- Those liabilites are reinsured & managed by National Indemnity Company and Resolute Management Services Ltd, both part of Berkshire Hathaway
- Established to manage liabilites arising from 1992 and prior YOAs, not authorised to write new business

### RITC

- RITC allows investors to pass run-off liabilities to a willing buyer if one can be found

### Subscription market

## London Market

- Centered around Lloyd's, insurers active in the LM include:
  - Lloyd's syndicates
  - Subs/branches of overseas (re)insurance companies
  - RI departments of UK composite companies
  - RI subs of UK composite companies
  - Small professional RI companies controlled by large broking firms for specific purpose of transacting LM business
  - Captive companies owned by UK/overseas companies
  - P&I Clubs and other mutuals
  - Pools, companies owned by group of (re)insurance companies

## Self-retention groups

- Primary purpose = provide self-insurance for owners' and members' insurance risks
  - Captive insurer, P&I Club, mutual association: groups of professional people

**Captives**

- Definition := _"An insurer wholly owned by an industrial or commercial enterprise and set up with the primary purpose of insuring the parent or associated group companies, and retaining premiums and risk within the enterprise. Some insurers are set up with the primary purpose of selling insurance to the customers of the parent. These are often known as captives but, as they write third-party business, this is not strictly correct. If the word ‘captive’ is used without qualification it should be assumed that only the parent or associated group companies are being insured. Lighter regulatory capital requirements for captive reinsurers only apply if the purpose of the captive is to provide cover exclusively for the risks of the undertaking or group to which it belongs and so does not provide cover for third parties"_
- To fill gaps in insurance cover not available from traditional market at acceptable price
  - Gaps caused by diminishing capacity of LM at times in UW cycle or reluctance to write certain LoBs (environmental pollution)
- Manage total insurance spending of large companies / groups
- Focus effort on risk management
- Gain tax, legislative, regulatory advantages
- Gain access to RI market
- Gain benefit of treating premium as genuine business expense (if at arm's length) -> parent company builds up reserves from pre-tax profits by paying premiums to captive

- Needs to be authorised as an insurer
  - Alternative: parent incurrs expense of using authorised insurer to front its insurance operations -> insurer writes risk and "reinsures" 100% to captive (captive still needs authorisation as reinsurer)
  - Risk to fronter: default risk of captive -> charge parent for this risk
- Captive can provide insurance risks to non-parent provided it does not change main purpose (providing cover to customers of parent := `Open captive`)
- Captive can front business itself and reinsure all/most of risk
- Captive advantages & disadvantages == self-insurance advantages & disadvantages
  - Provision of technical service under own control, pricing insurance risks
  - Lack of risk transfer (only offset by use of RI)
  - Suffer from concentration of risk
  - Lack of expertise when dealing with complex claims

**Protection & Indemnity ("P&I") Clubs**

- Mutual association of ship owners cover as pool risks not insured by commercial marine policy (not acceptable price):
  - Indemnity of liability in respect of claims for loss of life / personal injury resulting from accidents
  - Indemnity of liability for damage to harbours, wreck removal and pollution
- P&I Clubs provide high proportion of world's shipping coverage against liability claims due to mutual nature and technical expertise
- Members are commercial ship owners - majority exposed to unlimited joint and several liabilites
- Some clubs write fixed premium business -> provides maximum premium
- Almost all marine P&I Clubs are members of the International Group of P&I Clubs (co-ordinates operation and regulation of club's pooling agreement)
- Each loss above fixed amount pooled amonst members in accordance with formula depending on claim history
  - Group reinsurers part of pool in market
  - Group operates captive shares risks in pool
  - Some clubs buy own RI below the pool attachment point

**Other mutuals**

- Members join together to form self-retention groups to share risks and collectively seek RI arrangements
  - Professional bodies for professional indemnity cover
  - Energy risks - exploration and drilling
  - Nuclear power risks

## Acquisition of business

**Non LM business**

- Intermediaries: brokers, banks, building societies - paid commission
- Staff directly employed
- Internet, telesales, post, off-the-page
  - Insurance company has distribution division/sub devoted to direct sales
  - Insurer pays no commission -> reduces costs of acquiring business
  - Not always case direct marketing costs < commission
- Aggregators: websites submit prospective policyholder's details to many other sites, collect quotes (ideally on like-for-like basis), compare side-by-side.
  - Can be classed as brokers - depends on how they make their money
  - Some countries (e.g. Ireland) do not have aggregator sites

**Issues with PPI and preventing mis-selling**

- Insurance not underwritten at sales stage
- Taken out by customers without careful consideration if right for their circumstances or attention to policy eligibility conditions
- Individuals who purchase a policy without advice have little recourse if policy does not benefit them
  - Most PPI policies not sought out by consumers - sometimes not even aware they had the insurance
- PPI mis-sold, compliants mishandled, mis-selling by banks/providers and 3rd party brokers - encouraged by large commissions (insurance make bank/provider more money than interest on original loan)
- Competition Commission investigation order - 6 April 2011, rules in October 2011 (some April 2012):
  - Provision of adequate information when selling payment protection and providing a personal quote
  - Obligation to provide an annual review
  - Prohibition of selling payment protection at the same time the credit agreement is entered into

**LM business**

- Risks too large to be insured entirely by one insurer -> co-insured
- `Line` := Particular co-insurer's % share of a risk
- Lloyd's Act requires Lloyd's business introduced by Lloyd's broker / any broker that meet equivalent requirements
- Service companies approved to introduce personal lines business into Lloyd's

**Underwriting agencies**

- Large source of LM business is underwriting agencies == `Managing General Agents` ("MGAs")
- MGAs underwrite business on behalf of insurers
- `Binding authority` := insurer agreed contract with agency
  - Specify agreed period agency can place insurer on risk for certain classes under agreed policy wordings
- Problems: agencies paid % of premiums as commission
  - Conflict of interest: incentive to increase volume of business written without sufficient regard for profitability
  - Important interest of agency and insurer aligned
  - Important insurer has good access to exposure data
- Many MGAs formed by brokers -> efficient way of doing LM business
- Agency might be formed by company established for that reason
  - Comapny establish specialist MGA to underwrite risks on behalf of an insurer, e.g. caravan owners
  - Agency formed with specialist risk management functions in-house to write specialist business on behalf of insurer, e.g. environmental pollution

## Administration of business

- Generate material to PHers and internal use
- UWing info held:
  - Issue original policy
  - Cope with endorsements := policy wording changes that take effect during original period of insurance, usually follow change in risk covered (often alter original premium)
  - Cope with renewal processes
- Claims info held:
  - Cope with possibility of multiple claims / claimants
- Intermediaries may take on part of admin responsibility -> commission paid reflects extent intermediary involved
