## Lloyd's

- Lloyd's Act of 1871
- Market framework within which insurance conducted by members
- Historically not an insurer in its own right -> no insurance risk
- Lloyd's of London established Lloyd's Brussels (Lloyd's Insurance Company S.A.)
  - Ability to write insurance business within the EEA
  - Authorised and regulated by National Bank of Belgium
  - All non-EEA business written in same way -> business insured directly with members
  - Business written though Lloyd's Brussels insured by Lloyd's Brussels and 100% reinsured by syndicates with Lloyd's -> continues protection benefit by Lloyd's capital structure

### Annual Venture & RITC

### Subscription market

## London Market

- Centered around Lloyd's, insurers active in the LM include:
  - Lloyd's syndicates
  - Subs/branches of overseas (re)insurance companies
  - RI departments of UK composite companies
  - RI subs of UK composite companies
  - Small professional RI companies controlled by large broking firms for specific purpose of transacting LM business
  - Captive companies owned by UK/overseas companies
  - P&I Clubs and other mutuals
  - Pools, companies owned by group of (re)insurance companies

## Self-retention groups

- Primary purpose = provide self-insurance for owners' and members' insurance risks
  - Captive insurer, P&I Club, mutual association: groups of professional people

**Captives**

- Definition := _"An insurer wholly owned by an industrial or commercial enterprise and set up with the primary purpose of insuring the parent or associated group companies, and retaining premiums and risk within the enterprise. Some insurers are set up with the primary purpose of selling insurance to the customers of the parent. These are often known as captives but, as they write third-party business, this is not strictly correct. If the word ‘captive’ is used without qualification it should be assumed that only the parent or associated group companies are being insured. Lighter regulatory capital requirements for captive reinsurers only apply if the purpose of the captive is to provide cover exclusively for the risks of the undertaking or group to which it belongs and so does not provide cover for third parties"_
- To fill gaps in insurance cover not available from traditional market at acceptable price
  - Gaps caused by diminishing capacity of LM at times in UW cycle or reluctance to write certain LoBs (environmental pollution)
- Manage total insurance spending of large companies / groups
- Focus effort on risk management
- Gain tax, legislative, regulatory advantages
- Gain access to RI market
- Gain benefit of treating premium as genuine business expense (if at arm's length) -> parent company builds up reserves from pre-tax profits by paying premiums to captive

- Needs to be authorised as an insurer
  - Alternative: parent incurrs expense of using authorised insurer to front its insurance operations -> insurer writes risk and "reinsures" 100% to captive (captive still needs authorisation as reinsurer)
  - Risk to fronter: default risk of captive -> charge parent for this risk
- Captive can provide insurance risks to non-parent provided it does not change main purpose (providing cover to customers of parent := `Open captive`)
- Captive can front business itself and reinsure all/most of risk
- Captive advantages & disadvantages == self-insurance advantages & disadvantages
  - Provision of technical service under own control, pricing insurance risks
  - Lack of risk transfer (only offset by use of RI)
  - Suffer from concentration of risk
  - Lack of expertise when dealing with complex claims

**Protection & Indemnity ("P&I") Clubs**

- Mutual association of ship owners cover as pool risks not insured by commercial marine policy (not acceptable price):
  - Indemnity of liability in respect of claims for loss of life / personal injury resulting from accidents
  - Indemnity of liability for damage to harbours, wreck removal and pollution
- P&I Clubs provide high proportion of world's shipping coverage against liability claims due to mutual nature and technical expertise
- Members are commercial ship owners - majority exposed to unlimited joint and several liabilites
- Some clubs write fixed premium business -> provides maximum premium
- Almost all marine P&I Clubs are members of the International Group of P&I Clubs (co-ordinates operation and regulation of club's pooling agreement)
- Each loss above fixed amount pooled amonst members in accordance with formula depending on claim history
  - Group reinsurers part of pool in market
  - Group operates captive shares risks in pool
  - Some clubs buy own RI below the pool attachment point

**Other mutuals**

- Members join together to form self-retention groups to share risks and collectively seek RI arrangements
  - Professional bodies for professional indemnity cover
  - Energy risks - exploration and drilling
  - Nuclear power risks
