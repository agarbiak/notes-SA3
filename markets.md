## Self-retention groups

- Primary purpose = provide self-insurance for owners' and members' insurance risks

**Captives**

- Definition := _"An insurer wholly owned by an industrial or commercial enterprise and set up with the primary purpose of insuring the parent or associated group companies, and retaining premiums and risk within the enterprise. Some insurers are set up with the primary purpose of selling insurance to the customers of the parent. These are often known as captives but, as they write third-party business, this is not strictly correct. If the word ‘captive’ is used without qualification it should be assumed that only the parent or associated group companies are being insured. Lighter regulatory capital requirements for captive reinsurers only apply if the purpose of the captive is to provide cover exclusively for the risks of the undertaking or group to which it belongs and so does not provide cover for third parties"_
- To fill gaps in insurance cover not available from traditional market at acceptable price
  - Gaps caused by diminishing capacity of LM at times in UW cycle or reluctance to write certain LoBs (environmental pollution)
- Manage total insurance spending of large companies / groups
- Focus effort on risk management
- Gain tax, legislative, regulatory advantages
- Gain access to RI market
- Gain benefit of treating premium as genuine business expense (if at arm's length) -> parent company builds up reserves from pre-tax profits by paying premiums to captive
