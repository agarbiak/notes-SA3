## PPOs

- Certain circumstances, general insurer pay out claim as annuity rather than lump sum
  - Either: Legal court requirement to indemnify beneficiary this way,
  - Or: policy condition
  - Or: optional choice of claimant
- Claims settled this way known as **periodic payment orders** (`PPOs`)
- Equivalent to non-life annuities
- PPO := "_order made by court to pay compensation to victim of accident / act of malpractice, in form of series of regular payments rather than single lump sum_"
- Complications: size/term of payments, investment (inflation) considerations, capital requirements, RI recoveries, longevity risk, credit risk
- PPO claims arise from seriously/permanently injured, continuing & lifetime care and treatment
- Commonly awarded to young claimants => impact of injury on claimant's future life expectancy more uncertain
- PPOs rare for claims < £1m
- Introduced in 2005, prior to this **structured settlements** := optional annuity (very different characteristics / legal implications)
- Number of PPO awards grew significantly from 2008 court case "_Thompstone vs Thameside & Glossop Acute Services NHS Trust_"
  - PPOs permitted to be linked to **ASHE 6115** := index related to claimant's care costs (rather than RPI)
- Mostly arise from motor insurance
  - Also awarded for personal injury in other liability classes (e.g. EL, public liability)
  - Less common due to limits of liability (statutory minimum of EL cover in UK is £5m per event) => negates money management benefit of regular payments as stop once limit hit
- Common in medical negligence
  - NHS Resolution := body responsible for claims against public sector medical staff, large portfolio of PPO claims
- PPO form: specified sum paid every year until death, inflated in line with inflation index designed to reflect type of inflation relevant to award
  - Some PPOs have stepped payments := adjustments to annual payments (e.g. child reaches maturity => care needs change)
- Alternative to PPO is lump sum
  - If court authorises lump sum in place of PPO, calculation of lump sum based on prescribed set of mortality tables and discount rate (`Ogden tables`)

`Ogden tables` = set of tables used to calculate special damages and the present value of loss of earnings or annual expenses in personal injury and fatal accident cases. Tables provide multipliers which take account of life expectancies and a range of discount rates and are prepared by the UK Government Actuaries’ Department. The discount rate is set by the UK Lord Chancellor.

**Advantages and disadvantages of PPOs**

- Relative value of lump sum and PPO different depending on specific circumstances and risk averseness of insurer and claimant
- Longevity risk := Claimants find utility of large capital lump sum important but balance against risk of money running out while still in need of benefits
- Investment risk: insurer with PPO bears risk - difficult/impossible to match assets to liabilites
  - Nature of longevirty risk from set of young/impaired lives on small portfolio => difficult to match
  - Liabilities linked to earnings index => no matching assets
  - Long term nature => reduces appropriateness of match further
- Investment risk: claimant who takes lump sum if attempt to replicate payments received from a PPO
- Motor insurer expects handful of PPOs each year however stay on balance sheet until claimant dies (very long period)
  - Remainder of motor book mainly short term
  - Implies reserves for PPOs build up over time as proportion of overall book
- Capital requirements higher due to increased uncertainty from longevity, non-matching investment returns from assets to inflation, especially longer term
- Credit risk: Long-term nature of PPOs, increased risk of RI failure over lifetime of PPO
- Solvency II: additional reporting requirements fro non-life annuities, treated as life business once they come into payment

### Reserving for PPOs

- Approach varies by purpose (solvency, accounting, budgeting, commuting, transferring liabilty)
- Payments expected paid regularly in future, depends on annuitant survival, linked to inflation index
- Long term nature of liabilites, consistency with alternative lump sum => reserves discounted to PV
- Approach for annuity reserving varies by stage of development:
  - Annuities currently in payment
  - Incurred claims reported but not yet known whether settle as PPO
  - IBNR, some of which will settle as PPO
- Annuity payments in triangles distorts development patterns
  - Strip out such payments, value separately

**Annuities currently in payment**

- Cashflow valuation model with:
  - Current annuity level
  - Step up over time
  - Indexation
  - Life expectancy of claimant
  - Appropriate mortality table to use, include allowance for impairment
  - Discount rate (term dependent)
  - RI
- Allow for impaired mortality
  - Mortality rates based on standard published table
  - Impaired mortality allowed by loading mortality rates: additive / multiplicative adjustment or adjust age of claimant
  - Life expectancy based on medical expert in legal proceedings
- Most RI contracts have specific indexation clauses for PPOs => complicates net cashflows
  - RI contract may also **capitalisation clause** w.r.t. PPOs := if PPO settles in future, RI pay cedant lump sum to remove PPO liability from book

**Future PPOs**

- Allowance for large claims that may eventually be PPOs
- Cost of settling claim as PPO can be very different to settling it as lump sum - difference should be reserved for on claims that will settle as PPOs (but yet to do so)
- Covers claims not been settled but recognised as large / potential PPOs
- Also reserves needed for claims not yet recognised as large and claims not yet reported
- **PPO uplift** := extra amount reserved for claims that are going to be settled as PPOs
- Uplift severity calculated from insurer's average extra cost of settling claim as PPO opposed to lump sum - based on own data or market benchmark
  - Main factor: discount rate difference insurer uses to value PPO vs. used to calculate award if paid as lump sum
  - Possible uplift negative if insurer uses higher discount rate than used to convert to lump sums
- **Propensity** := frequency of PPO claim settlement
  - Little data to base this assumption
  - Care using industry benchmarks - different policy mix / claims processes
  - Depends on discount rate used to settle lump sums - claimant could receive higher lump sum as alternative to PPO => less likely to settle as PPO
- Uplift also for claims not yet reported that will become PPOs => adjustment to standard IBNR projection

### Capital for PPOs

- Capital implementations of non-life annuities complex
  - Long term nature of liabilities
  - Many risks not easily hedgeable: longevity, inflation
- High capital requirements from increased uncertainty:
  - Longevity
  - Non-matching investment returns from assets to inflation
  - Credit risk from long-term nature of PPOs
- Time horizon of SII capital measure = 1 year
  - Consider treatment for longer term uncertainties in the Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (`ORSA`) and MI
- Capital model that does not allow for PPOs => difficult to pass **Use Test**
- SII 1 in 100 stress test for longevity risk under standard form SCR => assume 20% drop in mortality rates
- Long-term risks inherent in running off PPOs will affect risk margin
  - Calculating it properly requres full investigation
