## Large risk definition

- Risk / group of risks which are to some extent unique
  - Calculations done which are applied once to that one risk
  - Unique nature of risk => calculations carried out for other risks and portfolios limited use for large risk under consideration

### Large clients

- Large risks can be vastly different in terms of size (exposure) and in terms of occupation, construction, susceptibility to natural disaster
- Large and complex risks individually underwritten
  - Underwriter uses unqiue info about the risk to dictate terms and conditions
  - Underwriter can be flexible in approach
    - What cover is offered
    - How cover is applied
    - What pricing is needed to fit precisely coverage required
- As companies get larger / more complex => circumstances change => challenge for pricing actuary:
  - Larger companies typically carry out more than one type of work,in more than one location
  - Amount company can afford to spend on risk management increases
    - Differences between good / bad risk management more noticeable
  - Larger companies likely use captives for self-insurance
  - Level of each premium higher => underwriter spend more time looking at each risk
  - Exact terms and conditions of cover and levels of sums insured change from being same for each risk
    - Subject to negotiation, e.g. at each renewal
  - Potentially claims handled up to limit by client in-house
  - Potentially claims handled by client's preferred claims handling company
  - Claims handling company may change over time
  - Contract features (e.g. aggregate deductibles) that lead to greater volatility => futher consideration needed

### Schemes

- Contract between insurer and another institution wherby insurer insures group of thrid parties agreed under contract
- Not one insured risk but group of insured risks priced collectively under one contract
- Risks likely to be similar to one another
  - Similarity via trade association / affinity group
- Alternatively individual risks share a defined brand
  - Likely individual risks sourced via same intermediary
- Schemes cover personal and commercial lines
  - Nature of scheme affect approach used in pricing risks
  - Approaches vary widely
  - Example: commercial motor insurance scheme cover for cars and vans => priced similar way to personal lines scheme
    - Volume and data available for this scheme enables pricing exercise similar to book of private motor business (credibility approach: weight on fleet's past claims experience, weight on standard book rates)
  - Example 2: car dealership, policies in scheme are private motor insurance policies sold when dealership sells new/used cars
    - Affinity relationship: all policyholders bought new/used car from same dealership
    - Scheme mirros book of private motor business to some extent => priced similarly
- Where group of risks within scheme priced collectively with set of rates that apply only to that group of risks (scheme) => scheme := pseudo large risk
  - Example: Local authority scheme providing liability insurance for members (individual local authorities)
    - Individual risks share affinity since all local authorities
    - Volume and data available unlikely sufficient to price similar to personal lines business

### Delegation

- Most schemes involve element of delegation
  - Claims handling, underwriting, sales, etc.
- More functions delegated => less control insurer has over part of process and data associated with that function
