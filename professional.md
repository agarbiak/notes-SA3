## Actuarial associations

- International Actuarial Association (`IAA`) develops International Standards of Actuarial Practice (`ISAPs`) := model standards of practice
- The IAA encourages member associations to have standards of practice substantially consistent with these standards
- ISAPs are model standards of actuarial practice => not binding on any actuary
- ISAP 1 provides guidance to actuaries when performing actuarial services to give intended users confidence that:
  - actuarial services are carried out professionally and with due care
  - the results are relevant to their needs, presented clearly, understandably, complete
  - assumptions, methodology, techniques are disclosed appropriately
- ISAP 1A extends ISAP 1 with specific mention of models, their techniques and governance
- ISAP 4 complements IFRS 17, focuses on actuarial aspects of the measurement
  - Principle based
  - Facilitate convergence in standards of actuarial practice
  - Address complexities related to projecting future cash flows, future management actions, risk adjustments, discount rates (especially beyond investment horizon)
- ISAP 5 relates to the provision of actuarial services as regards enterprise risk models

- Actuarial Association of Europe (`AAE`) develops European Standards of Actuarial Practice (`ESAPs`)
  - ESAP 1 ~= ISAP 1
  - ESAP 2 requires that the intended users of the Actuarial Function Report (under SII) should be able to place a high degree of reliance on the report, its relevance, transparency of assumptions, completeness and comprehensibility, including the communication of any uncertainty inherent in the results stated in the report.
