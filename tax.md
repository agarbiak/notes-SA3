## Taxing insurance companies

- Deemed tax resident if incorporated locally or incorporated overseas but managed & controlled in the country
- Tax resident company subject to corporation tax on worldwide profits
  - Option to elect not to be taxed on profits of foreign **permanent establishments**
- Actuarial calcs should consider all taxes may be exposed and adequately allow for them
- Profits calculated for tax purposes likely to differ from those disclosed in financial statements, differences:
  - Investment return, notably on equity income & gains
  - Underwriting result
  - Foreign profits
  - Other items: depreciation, disallowable entertainment
- Pay corporation tax on taxable profits
  - Credit relife may be due for foreign tax
  - Corporation tax due to be paid in set way, interest due on late payments, penalities from underestimations
  - UK rate is 19%

## Investment return

- Made up income and gains from government/corporate bonds, deposits, equities, collective investment schemes (`CIS`), real estate, misc sources (investment underwriting, stock lending fees)
- Insurance == financial trade => some regions no distinction made for tax purposes between investment income and investment gains of general insurer (both taxed as income)

**Bonds, deposits, certain CIS**

- Distinction: investment return arising from **loan relationships** and **equities**
- **Loan relationships** := tax term, describes money debts arising from lending/advancing money
  - All forms of corporate, government debt and deposits
  - CIS that invest predominately in loan relationships
- Investment return from loan relationships calculated using authorised accounting method (e.g. fair value basis)

**Equities, equity-based CIS, real estate**

- Some regimes: Income dividends not taxed (whether local/foreign equities) subject to anti-avoidance measures
- Gains on equities (whether local/foreign):
  - Either: Taxed as income so unrealised gains/losses brough into account for tax purposes as they accrue in financial statements
  - Or: taxed only on realisation

**Other income**

- Misc income (stock-lending fees) generally taxed as earned and recognised in financial statements

## Underwriting result and provisions

- UWing result calculated with reference to local **generally accepted accounting principles** (`GAAP`)
  - IFRS 17 due to come into effect on 1 January 2023
- Technical provisions (`TPs`) are usually deductible for tax purposes if calculated under GAAP
  - Local tax legislation may limit tax deduction to _appropriate amount_
  - Insurers make corporation tax returns on basis of figures in financial statements
  - Local tax authority may enquire, _appropriate amount_ depends on whether written (actuarial) opinion supports the figure
  - UK example: _appropriate amount_ changed to undiscounted best estimate if less and excess disallowed for tax purposes. Disallowance may be allowed to reverse in next year (subject to further disallowance at end of that year)
  - Written actuarial opinion in accordance with actuarial standards, confirm based on info at time of financial statements adopted, amount is _not excessive_
  - Tax authorties may have additional powers: power to commission an independent report into provisions (not common, usually enquiries resolved based on information provided)
- Reported claims provisions - generally allowable
  - Requirements by tax authorities: support them with case estimates / statistical projections
- Provisions for unearned premiums (`UPR`) - calculated in most accurate manner available, subject to certain conditions
  - Acquisition costs related to unearned premiums may be deferred through established of a deferred-cost asset
- Additional unexpired risk reserve (`URR` or `AURR`) - accepted under some tax regimes
  - Restrictions possible: required to prove can be established on statistical basis
  - Prove that UPR (net of acquistion costs) inadequate to meet losses on uneared premiums
- Provision for IBNR - usually acceptable subject to justification for existence and extent of such claims
  - Most difficult for classes subject to great claim variation (latent claims especially)
- Claims handling expense provision (`CHE`) := provision for internal and external claims handling expenses
  - Generally allowable, subject to extent expenses relate directly to claims for which claims provisions have been accepted by local tax supervisor
  - Tax supervisors test whether provision calculated with sufficient accuracy to enable provision to be considered _specific_ => tax deductible
- TPs claimed for tax usually net of RI recovery
  - Tax purposes: assume all amounts due recoverable
  - Deduction allowed for specific provisions for amounts estimated irrecoverable
  - General bad debt provision not allowed
- Equalisation provisions != TPs
  - Prior to SII, insurers required to establish equalisation reserve over and above claims provisions in certain (potentially volatile) CoBs
  - Stat rules governed calculation of transfers to the reserve (tax deductible, unless elected otherwise) and transfers from the reserve (tax payable, unless previously elected otherwise when set up)
  - Under SII, regulatory requirement to have equalisation provisions no longer exists
  - Legislation to remove future entitlement to tax deduction for equalisation provisions and bring back into tax all transfers that had previously given rise to tax deductions applies from accounting periods ending on/after 1 Jan 2016
  - Charge to tax on release of provisions held at 1 Jan 2016 spread over 6 year period, insurer option to pay full amount remaining at any stage
  - Some jurisdictions, equalisation provisions still allowed
- Provisions for future CAT losses not allowable under SII, allowable for some jurisdictions
  - Previously deductible under equalisation reserve rules prior to SII

## Other considerations

- Tax law require other adjustments to P&L shown in financial statements
- Examples not deductible:
  - business entertaining expenses
  - depreciation
  - some amortisation charges
- Special rules for calculating _**capital allowances**_ - tax term to describe allowable tax depreciation
- Special rules allow tax deduction for amortisation of certain intangible fixed assets

**Foreign profits**

- If insurer has business through permanent (_deemed_) establishment (`PE`) outside local region => maybe liable for foreign taxes
- If holds foreign investments => maybe foreign withholding tax on dividends and interest
- Complex rules, maybe foreign taxes credited against local corporation tax
  - Less advantageously, maybe allowed as deduction in computing local taxable profits
- Resident companies election (maybe irrevocable) to not be taxed locally on profits/losses attributable to foreign PEs
  - If irrevocable applies to all future periods
  - Effect to take out of account for tax purposes all profits/losses from current & future foreign PEs
- If company elects branch exemption, foreign taxes relate to exempt foreign branch maybe not allowed to be credited/deducted against local tax

**Tax losses**

- Some regions, company sustains tax loss => no corporation tax payable
- 3 ways companies relieve trading losses:
  - Carried back and set against previous year's profits
  - Carried forward and set against future trading profits
  - Surrendered to other companies in same regional tax group, offset by their taxable profits, restrictions on ability of a branch within group to surrender its losses
- Amount of losses transferable/carried restricted on regional tax decisions
- _Loss absorbency capacity of deferred tax_ := losses allowed for in calculation of capital under SII

## Taxing mutuals

- UWing profits/losses arising from mutual trading (maybe) exempt from tax
  - (Maybe) no tax relief given for expenses part of mutual trade
- Investment return taxed independently
  - Return from loan relationships (maybe) taxed differently to other investments
- If mutual makes UWing loss, loss (maybe) not allowed to be offset against gross investment return
- Many P&I Clubs historically entered into special arrangements with their local tax authorities

## Tax in Lloyd's market

- Tax levied on members of LLoyd's, taxed in UK on worldwide Lloyd's profits (subject to branch exemption election)
- Member's taxable profits = aggregate of:
  - share of profits/losses from syndicate activity
  - profits/losses from activity outside syndicate (`member-level items`)

**Syndicate result**

- Tax result for syndicate calculated on basis of YOA results
- Deferally in taxing results: YOA 2021 result taxed in 2024 (Year 4)
- If syndicate does not close after 36 months, result at 36 months is taxed in Year 4, annual movement taxed in subsequent year until it closes
- Syndicate management agent responsible to declare tax result and agree with HMRC
  - Syndicate result attributed to participants on syndicate
- Challenges by HMRC to level of TPs made at level of syndicate result, adjustment to appropriate amount in practice need account for RI ceded at member level

**Member level result**

- Member-level result generally calculated on current CY basis
  - Special timing rules for member-level RI and amounts payable to syndicate managing agent
- Premiums ceded by corporate members under member-level RI and recoveries made by members under member-level RIs taxed in same period as relevant syndicate YOA
  - Where member-level RI entered into for a CY => relevant sums apportioned to the constituent YOA for tax purposes
  - Amounts payable by member to managing agent also taxed on syndicate YOA basis
- Member's responsibility to declare in tax return both its share of relevant syndicate result and any other income/expenses
- Lloyd's members have deferral of taxation on UWing and related investment return within the syndicate PTFs until 4th development year
  - Tax benefit on losses also deferred
- Lloyd's corporate members benefit from same dividend exemption rules as UK insurers => tax exempt where mark-to-market valuation basis used
  - Individual members (and individuals in partnerships) taxed on dividends
- Lloyd's corporate members _Claims Equalisation Reserves_ set up prior to SII, 6 year period for taxing release of accrued provisions (since 1 Jan 2016)
- Significant part of Lloyd's profits subject to tax overseas as arising in foreign PEs
  - Effective rate of tax on those profits depend on extent to which corporate members obtain credit relief against UK tax for those foreign taxes
  - UK double taxation relife rules modified to cater for Lloyd's YOA basis of UK taxation

## Other tax

**Insurance premium tax**

- Some countries: Insurance premiums exempt from Value Added Tax (`VAT`) / Goods and Services Tax (`GST`)
- Insurance premiums (maybe) subject to Insurance Premium Tax (`IPT`)
  - Some forms of insurance also exempt from IPT
  - Some insurance exempt from IPT in local domicile if risk is overseas (maybe tax levied in overseas regime)
- Different rate of tax may apply to certain types of insurance if commonly sold using certain sales channel
  - Example: Extended warranty business sold alongside white goods (maybe) taxed at same rate as white goods
- When IPT changes => insurance premiums paid vary in line with change
  - If IPT isn't explicitly listed separately, insurer could decided to make change to its base rates at same time => competitor analysis / increase market share
  - If so, maintain same rates post-IPT => reduces premium received post-IPT
- UK IPT is 12%, 20% rate for travel and insurance sold along basic product subjec to VAT
- UK exempt IPT: Commercial ships/aircraft, commercial goods in transit, reinsurance

**VAT / GST**

- VAT = GST := tax on consumption, often collected at stage of supply cycle by requiring supplier to charge and account for VAT on supplies of goods/services but with deduction for input tax on purchases of goods/services for use in business
- Many cases business does not bear VAT but is responsible for collecting VAT on value it adds in supply chain
- In insurance concept is modified by making business a consumer => VAT a cost
  - EU example: supply of insurance within EU as exempt supply so business does not have to charge VAT on its supplies but consequent not entitled to recover any related VAT input tax on costs it incurs => insurer does not include VAT in premiums it charges
- Supply of insurance outside EU = outside scope of VAT => business does not charge VAT but entitled to recover VAT input tax
- Insurers commonly partially exempt from VAT, mixture of VAT-exempt, outside scope, VAT-able supplies => amount of VAT recover on costs depends on mix of supplies they make

**Policyholder taxation**

- Premiums
  - Paid by corporate PHer maybe allowed as business expense (some regional tax laws)
  - Paid by personal PHers usually paid out of post-tax income, sole traders/partnerhsips maybe allowed to deduct insurance premiums as trading expense of carrying on business
- Claims: indemnify PHers => do not create profit
  - Receipt of claims payment can be taxable depending on natur of risk insured against and whether premium was tax deductible
  - Likely taxable for business PHers where replace lost profits => subject to tax / diminish tax deductible expenses
- Capital gains tax: receipt of compensation / insurance moneys maybe not treated as disposal where sums used to restore/replace asset
  - Can be interaction between capital gains rules and capital allowances
- IPT is a tax on consumption, usually collected by the insurer
  - If IPT very large => disincentive to PHers to purchase insurance
    - Problem for mandatory insurance classes (e.g. motor) due to increased uninsured drivers with those costs passed back to insurers passed onto orignal insureds
    - Problem for non-mandatory insurance for future governments (e.g. home) due to poor people living in CAT prone areas where housing cheap, public pressure on government to support affected people by CAT => costs more than extra IPT received
